The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plans to begin environmental remediation efforts at residential properties near the former Federated Metals facility in Whiting and Hammond in 2025. From 1937 to 1983, the 36-acre facility operated as a smelting, refining, recovery and recycling facility for non-ferrous metals including copper, zinc and lead. Extensive remediation work was conducted at the Superfund site beginning in 2001. Some of the metals have also contaminated sediment within Lake George, which abuts the site. Planned remedial actions include soil excavation on properties with lead levels above 400 ppm. The first phase of excavation will cover sampled properties with access agreements. Follow-up phases of excavation will be based on additional soil sampling and access agreements. Additional investigation will be carried out to determine potential vapor intrusion and groundwater exposure. The project is valued at $50 million or more. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 W.

2023-11-09,"Construction Nonfatal-Injury Illness Rate Dips, as Cases Rise Slightly",https://www.enr.com/articles/57549-construction-nonfatal-injury-illness-rate-dips-as-cases-rise-slightly,9-Nov-23,"The construction industry showed improvement last year in a key safety indicator, its rate of nonfatal jobsite injuries and illnesses, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. 

But the bureau's report, released Nov. 8, also shows the number of nonfatal construction injuries and illnesses edged up marginally.

The industry’s nonfatal injury/illness rate dipped to 2.4 per 100 full-time workers, from 2.5 in 2021. The rate for 2020 also was 2.5.

There were 169,600 construction cases of nonfatal injuries and illnesses in 2022, up from 169,200 in the previous year. That increase is about 0.2%

Construction safety specialists see the injury/illness rate as a more important indicator than the total number of cases because the rate adjusts for increases in the total workforce.

For the 12 months ending last Dec. 31, construction employment rose by 265,000, or 3.5%.

In another safety measurement, the report says construction's injury and illness rate for cases that led to days away from work­—a measure of serious injuries and illnesses—declined last year to 1.0 per 100 full-time workers, from 1.1 in 2021.

The number of days-away-from-work injuries and illnesses also dropped 1.5% last year, to 71,700, from 72,800 in 2021.

""We are encouraged that the rates of injuries and illnesses continue their downward trend, given increase of employment in construction,"" Chris Trahan Cain, the North America's Building Trades Unions director of health and safety, said in an email.


""While we know not all injuries and illnesses are recorded, the trends are important to watch and suggest that employers are taking their job to provide a safe workplace seriously,"" Trahan, also executive director of the Center for Construction Research and Training, added. CPWR is an affiliate of the building trades unions.

Brian Turmail, Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) vice president of public affairs and strategic initiatives, said in an email, ""The new data offers yet another reminder that—as much as the industry is doing to improve the safety and health of the construction workforce—we still have work to do to get to a point where everyone comes home safe and healthy.

""We need to remember that this data does not reflect the significant mental health crisis taking place within the industry that is leading too many workers to take their own lives,"" Turmail also said.

Joe Xavier, Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) senior director of health and safety, said in a statement, ""While one injury is too many and Associated Builders and Contractors is committed to working with our chapters and members to intentionally and systematically drive the rate to zero, the 2022 BLS report shows that the construction industry trended in the right direction.""

ABC thinks that as the industry increasingly adopts the ""total human health approach"" to safety, ""we will see fewer injuries, illnesses and fatalities,"" Xavier added.

2023-10-12,NY Bridge Safety Summit Eyes Suicide Prevention Measures,https://www.enr.com/articles/57308-ny-bridge-safety-summit-eyes-suicide-prevention-measures,12-Oct-23,"New York State Bridge Authority and Office of Mental Health representatives gathered state lawmakers, local emergency response teams and community leaders for a suicide prevention summit last month to raise awareness, discuss better collaboration and review suicide prevention and emergency mental health response practices around the state’s vehicular and pedestrian bridges, parks and other public spaces.

Held Sept. 22 in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and coinciding with Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, the Transportation for Life Summit marked the first of many steps to open a statewide dialogue about public suicide prevention and to create a “comprehensive approach to save lives and better support New Yorkers experiencing a mental health crisis,” said Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) in a press release.

The daylong summit program included prevention training sessions, keynote speakers and panel discussions featuring suicide prevention experts, survivors, as well as transportation professionals who spoke from experience about ongoing efforts to improve suicide prevention infrastructure around bridges.

In concurrent sessions, attendees learned about bridge design and engineering challenges for suicide prevention and language best practices for suicide intervention materials, such as signage, brochures and emergency messages.

With five bridges under the agency’s authority, Bridge Authority spokesperson Chris Steber said retrofitting those bridges with protective fencing remains a challenge because of cost, with an estimated $10-million to $85-million price tag. In the short term, NYSBA has focused on expanding on-site bridge resources, including an emergency phone system, cameras, signage deterrents and security staff trainings.

The aim was for summit attendees to understand that suicide prevention is a collective responsibility, explains Steber.

“No one person or one agency can solve the problem alone. But we can all work collectively and do our own part,” he says.",1,9,0,0
2023-06-27,Hawaii Health Officials Sign Off on Military Depot Defueling Plan,https://www.enr.com/articles/56701-hawaii-health-officials-green-light-military-depot-defueling-plan,27-Jun-23,"A U.S. Dept. of Defense plan to begin the gravity defueling of more than 100 million gallons of jet fuel stored underground in Hawaii will go forward after state health officials issued conditional approval on June 24. The defueling and closure of the U.S. Navy-operated Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Honolulu is on track to begin in October and conclude early next year, officials say.

The move comes after a series of major leaks from the 80-year-old tanks impacted the drinking water quality near the facility. Last year, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced that the facility would be permanently closed. The Joint Task Force-Red Hill was established by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command safely facilitate the defueling process in close coordination with the State of Hawaii.

The Defense Dept. plan, which was developed following an assessment by engineering firm Simpson Gumpertz & Heger, calls for gravity defueling to remove about 104 million gallons of fuel from 14 of the 20 tanks that comprise the massive underground facility.

The Hawaii Dept. of Health had initially rejected the plan last year, saying that the task force's effort was lacking on several points that concerned state officials. Since then, the Navy proposed eliminate the tanks from service while leaving them in the ground as well as also removing all three pipelines to ensure the tanks would not be used again.

Kathleen Ho, Hawaii’s deputy director of environmental health, said in a statement that the state’s conditional approval “is an important step forward to defuel Red Hill as quickly and safely as possible.”

“The joint task force must still complete several important steps before DOH will allow defueling to begin, and we will continue to oversee all work with safety as our top priority,” Ho said.

Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility is a 250-million-gallon-capacity fuel storage facility with 20 steel-lined, concrete storage tanks, each 250 ft tall and 100 ft in diameter with a 12.5-million-gallon capacity, built underground in cavities excavated beneath Red Hill. Three gravity-fed pipelines connect the tanks to fueling piers 2.5 miles away at Pearl Harbor. The facility was built during the 1940s, with work starting before the Dec. 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

In 2014, 27,000 gallons of fuel leaked out from one of the tanks. Following that leak, the Navy and Defense Logistics Agency stepped up modernization efforts and water monitoring under an agreement with the state. In 2021, another 19,000 gallons of fuel leaked following a pressure surge, which the EPA says impacted drinking water quality, and the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command formed the joint task force to lead the defueling. 

Earlier in June, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized a consent order with the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency earlier in the month for defueling and closure of the facility. 

The Defense Dept. plan includes five phases, of which three have been completed. Additional steps include hundreds of repairs to the pipeline and other parts of the facility, which are near completion. Each repair must have its quality validated by a third party and then reviewed by the state DOH. Once the tanks are emptied, the Navy has recommended leaving the empty tanks in place, which officials say would minimize the environmental, public health, safety and other impacts. 

Hawaii DOH officials also want to see operational plans for the defueling of separate surge tanks at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, as well as for pipeline repacking, defueling of the main tanks and tank bottoms and the pipeline unpacking before defueling can begin. 

Planning documents also note it is likely that between 100,000 and 400,000 gallons will remain after gravity defueling. Defense Dept. officials say they will continue to provide plan supplements to the Hawaii Dept. of Health and EPA to address the action that will be needed to ensure all the fuel is removed.

Defense Dept. records show contracts and task orders related to Red Hill have been awarded to several firms since the 2014 leak. AECOM Technical Services Inc. is providing drinking water monitoring, groundwater modeling and other environmental technical services.

Last year, Defense Dept. officials also awarded task orders to HDR Engineering Inc. for architecture-engineering services at Red Hill Water Treatment Facility; to Kiewit Infrastructure West Co. for road repairs and erosion control at the fuel storage facility and Vectrus System Corp. for operation of a 5-million-gallon-per-day granular activated carbon filtration system. A task force representative did not immediately respond to questions about additional contracting work. ",1,0,0,0

2023-05-03,"Mass., R.I. Stand Downs Raise Awareness On Mental Health, Addiction ",https://www.enr.com/articles/56377-mass-ri-stand-downs-raise-awareness-on-mental-health-addiction,3-May-23,"After Shawn Nehiley injured his back on the job in 2002 while working as a journeyman for Iron Workers Local 7, he was prescribed opioids for pain. “When they gave me the oxycontin, I felt like Superman, but that turned real quick,” he recalls. 

Speaking during an April 28 stand-down in Boston’s Seaport that concluded the third annual Building Trades Recovery Week, the president of the Ironworkers District Council of New England was one of several speakers who shared their story of addiction and recovery with approximately 500 workers. The Building Trades Employers’ Association Northeast organized the event along with Turner Construction Co., Suffolk Construction and WS Development.

The stand-down, which takes place during National Recovery Month, seeks to enjoin the unionized construction industry to fight substance use disorder, and help find ways to improve mental health and break through stigmas associated with these conditions. 

Additional stand-downs were held the same day by the New England Laborers’ Health and Safety Fund involving some 100 workers from Dimeo Construction and Shawmut Construction in Providence, R.I. Both events included a 60-second moment of silence to commemorate the 229 construction workers out of every 100,000 who die from substance use disorders each year. 



Fighting Back

An alcoholic, Nehily had been sober for 16 years when he sustained his back injury in 2002 and was prescribed opioids.  

""My life was good, I had gotten into the Ironworkers 14 years earlier,"" he says, ""I met a girl, had a son, bought a house and got married."" 

He was afraid to talk to anyone in his union hall about his opioid addiction. ""I tried hundreds of times on my own to quit and a hundred times I failed,"" he says. ""I went to four different detoxes.” 

A decade of addiction left him “a shell” of himself. “I had to use a drug to get out of bed every morning,” he says. ""I couldn’t get my act together” and he says he nearly got divorced. 

Recovery only started after his wife called the Iron Workers, who showed up at his house. He says it was his union brothers and sisters who saved his life by getting him back into detox and providing the support to keep him on the road to recovery. 

Nehily says a lot has changed since his second recovery. Today, you can seek help in a union hall, he says. “We won’t put you out on the street,” he says.



Sobering Statistics, Sobering Stories 

Construction workers represent 25% of fatal opioid overdoses among all workers, who are six to seven times more likely to die of a heroin overdose than workers in other industries, a BTEA Northeast statement notes. A 2020 study also found that 83% of all construction workers have experienced a mental health issue.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that construction has the highest suicide rate of all industries at 53.2 suicides per 100,000 workers. ""We've got to do something about it,"" said Tom S. Gunning, BTEA Northeast executive director, who shared his own struggles with addiction and recovery and was also named one of ENR's Top 25 Newsmakers of 2022.

Paul Greeley, executive director of the New England Carpenters Benefit Fund Carpenters Assistance Program, who has been sober for 27 years, said while his organization has made great strides since it was founded 35 years ago, statistically speaking, “one in 10 people [at the union stand down] have a substance abuse problem.” 

Greely noted that the average age of the workers who choose to keep “living the hard life using” is about 35 to 38 years old. The carpenters program offers eight short-term counseling sessions with no copays or insurance to help.

Martin F. Walsh, business manager for Laborers International Union Local 223, says he got sober 17 years ago after abusing alcohol for 51 years.

“Without help in recovery,"" he says, ""I would have been dead.” 

Daniel McNulty of the Massachusetts Building Trades Union says his organization has been working to build trust in peer-to-peer support. He was passing out stickers that read “Struggling?” for workers to put on their hardhats. The stickers have a QR code that provide a point person in each of the 14 trades if a union member or safety staff needs to seek help from the worker’s union hall. “The stickers can also help contractors who may not know the specific labor benefits a worker has,” he says.

Kayla Hallisey, an ironworker apprentice and three-year member of Iron Workers Local 7, says she joined the union three years after recovering from heroin addiction. The single mom goes to Narcotics Anonymous and has received counseling for herself and her 12-year-old son from the Iron Workers. “I feel supported by the local,” she says. “We know exactly where to go if we need assistance,” she says. She also sees other people she knows struggling. “I try to support them if they are nervous to go down to the hall.”",1,2,2,2
2023-02-16,US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh Says He Will Leave Post in March,https://www.enr.com/articles/55950-us-labor-secretary-marty-walsh-says-he-will-leave-post-in-march,16-Feb-23,"U.S. Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh, who is formerly Boston mayor and a top official at the regional building trades unions, will leave his federal post in mid-March to become executive director of the National Hockey League Players’ Association, the union and Walsh have announced.

In an email sent to Dept. of Labor employees on Feb. 16, Walsh said he had met with President Joe Biden “and he accepted that my time as Labor Secretary will conclude mid-March.”

The announcements followed many media reports in recent days that Walsh would be leaving his cabinet post for the players' union job.

Deputy Secretary Julie Su will become acting secretary, under a department statute, an agency spokesperson told ENR via email. She was confirmed to the position in July 2021.

Walsh praised Su, former secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency that enforces workplace laws and oversees occupational safety and health, for her “exceptional work and support.” He said she is “an incredible leader and has been central to our success as a team and as a department.""

The Senate confirmed Walsh as Secretary of Labor in March 2021. Before that, he served as Boston mayor for seven years and also had been elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, serving for 16 years. 

Walsh joined Laborers’ International Union of North America Local 223 in Boston when he was 21, with his father also a union member, and became the local’s president. In 2011, Walsh was named to lead the Boston Building and Construction Trades Council, a group composed of many construction unions in the area. He left that position in 2013 to run for mayor.



An ENR 2020 Newsmaker

ENR named Walsh one of its 25 Newsmakers for 2020, for being the first mayor of a major U.S. city to temporarily halt construction during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 early that year. 

In December 2020, about nine months after the pause took effect, Walsh helped coordinate health specialists, unions and construction industry executives on COVID-related protocols, who developed a testing, tracing and treatment initiative for construction workers.

He told ENR at the time that he was proud that Boston ""paused construction early and implemented safety guidance to keep workers and their families safe.""

In recounting Labor Dept. actions since he became secretary, Walsh told department staff, ""We promoted every worker’s right to form a union, rallied the entire federal government to advance labor rights and provided critical information and support to workers during a historic surge in union organizing activity.”

He added: ""We brought high-quality, equitable job training and career pathways to more workers in more places and across more industries.""



Industry Organizations React to Move

James Young, senior director of congressional relations, HR, labor and safety for the Associated General Contractors of America, says that while AGC did not always agree with department decisions and policies tunder Walsh, there were areas of common ground, and he typically took a collaborative approach. “He certainly understood the challenges our industry faces more than any other secretary of labor before him,” Young told ENR. 

During his tenure, Walsh has emphasized the need for expanding the domestic workforce through apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs with the large amount of work expected as a result of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. He also had an interest in mental health-related safety issues. Both of these interests are also priorities for AGC, Young said.

Su is still somewhat unknown in Washington, D.C., and in the construction industry, Young noted. With her background in law and regulatory enforcement at the state level, “We’ll have to see how she brings that regulatory enforcement at the federal level and if it’s different from what we’ve seen over last two years.”

LIUNA General President Terry O'Sullivan praised Walsh as ""a working class warrior"" and ""one of our own. He understands the value and importance of labor-management cooperation."" 

Among Walsh's accomplishments, O'Sullivan pointed to a department proposal to revise prevailing-wage rules. He says that, among other things, the revision would increase enforcement, halt ""wage theft"" and modernize how wages are set.

Regarding Su, O'Sullivan said, ""She has a strong track record, and we are eager to continue the progress made ... on the implementation of the prevailing-wage update.""

But he prompted some industry unease in announcing that a potentially broader Buy American mandate for projects is coming soon from his administration.  

In his Feb. 6 speech before a joint session of Congress, Biden repeated a comment he had made before— that the U.S. had once ranked first among countries for infrastructure but has since dropped to No. 13.

“But now we’re coming back,” Biden declared, pointing to the enactment of the $1.2-trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) in November 2021. The five-year measure is now in its second year on the books and Biden said that so far it has funded ""more than 20,000 projects.""

The White House provided more speech detail in a Feb. 8 fact sheet, stating that federal agencies have announced nearly $200 billion in IIJA funding for those projects or grant awards.

It also said the project total includes the launch of more than 3,700 bridge repairs and replacements and the start of upgrades for more than 69,000 miles of roadway.

“And folks, we’re just getting started,"" Biden said.

The President teased Republicans who voted against the IIJA but who also asked him to fund projects in their districts, he said. “I promised I’d be a president for all Americans,"" Biden said. ""We’ll fund these projects, and I’ll see you at the groundbreaking.”



Industry Reactions

Industry groups praised the attention Biden paid to infrastructure. Maria Lehman, president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said in a statement that the group “is encouraged that infrastructure remains a top priority for the Biden administration.”

She said in a statement that the positive “return on investment” from the 20,000 projects is clear.

The American Council of Engineering Cos., said in a statement that engineering firms are working to turn the infrastructure law's financial resources into “tangible results for the American people.”

But ACEC also said that “the country’s positive job numbers are tempered by the lack of engineers available to do all the work.”

The group urged Biden and Congress to work to address the engineering workforce shortage, through such actions as immigration reform legislation and more STEM education.

Terry O'Sullivan, general president of the Laborers' International Union of North America, said the administration ""is delivering for working men and women through historic investments that are creating good, family-supporting jobs...""

Associated Builders and Contractors President and CEO Michael Bellaman was critical of Biden policies, saying that as his term continues, “he can either continue with his anti-competitive executive orders or work with Republicans in Congress to find a better path forward through bipartisan solutions.”

In particular, Bellaman pointed to the administration’s support of project labor agreements on federally funded projects and of the Protecting the Right to Organize, or PRO Act, for which Biden reiterated his backing in his address. 

But Bellaman also welcomed that Biden addressed mental health in his speech and added that ABC “stands ready to work with this administration to prioritize total human health.”

David Long, National Electrical Contractors Association CEO, said in a statement said that the recent rise in infrastructure spending “presents real change” for member firms.

But Long also cautioned that issues related to the supply chain, high inflation, taxes and workforce shortages remain to be tackled.



Awaiting Buy America Guidance

But construction industry officials also took keen notice of the new Buy America standards.

Biden said that a Buy America provision has been in effect since 1933. ""But for too long past administrations—Democrat and Republican—fought to get around it,"" he said. ""Not any more—Tonight I'm also announcing new standards requiring all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America."" 

Biden specifically mentioned ""lumber, glass, drywall and fiber-optic cable,"" in noting what would be subject to the requirements.

The Associated General Contractors of America supports increasing U.S. manufacturing to help address supply-chain problems stemming in part from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Jimmy Christianson, vice president-government relations said in an interview.

But he added that seeking to shut down current processes for getting waivers from Buy America requirements for certain materials ""will delay projects.""

Christianson also said various state departments of transportation and other public-sector owners continue to have ""differing interpretations"" of how to implement current Buy America provisions.

The Office of Management and Budget issued a Buy America guidance document last April and, following up on Biden's comment, a new agency memo is expected soon that will ""try to better define what is and is not made in America,"" Christianson says.

In particular, he says that for federal-aid highway projects, there is ""a big push"" from Buy America advocates to drop a waiver for ""manufactured products"" from the domestic-preference requirement. That waiver took effect in 1983.

The IIJA has a number of provisions aimed at broadening the application of Buy America. But the statute specifically excludes cement, cementitious materials, aggregates and asphalt binder from Buy America requirements. 

The National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association successfully pushed to have that exclusions provision included in the IIJA.

Group President and CEO Michael Johnson said in a Feb. 8 statement: “This action to create the exclusion and ultimately include it in the [IIJA] law, as written by Congress, demonstrates the clear intent to exclude these materials.""

Johnson added, “Regardless of [the president’s] comments, the Biden administration still must follow the law as intended.”

In his speech, Biden did not mention aggregates, cement, binder and the other products covered by the association-backed IIJA exclusion.

But AGC's Christianson says it's unclear how OMB will treat concrete, even though cement is clearly excluded from Buy America requirements.

Canadian Lumber Watching Buy America Guidance

Canada's lumber industry also is interested in the coming Buy America guidance.

Linda Coady, president of the BC Lumber Trade Council, said in a Feb. 8 statement that Biden's statement about a new Buy America guidance announcement is ""concerning.""

Coady said  that the lumber council is ""seeking to better understand what this means for Canadian producers"" and added that ""our focus remains on working on both sides of the border to maximize the opportunity Canada has in providing the sustainably produced, low-carbon lumber products we know American homebuilders, consumers and construction workers want and need.""

Coady said that in 2021 U.S. lumber demand was more than 50 billion board feet and U.S. producers supplied 35 billion board ft.

The 15-billion-board ft difference was mainly filled by Canadian lumber, Coady added.

2022-10-18,California County Rejects JE Dunn's Lone Bid for Jail Project,https://www.enr.com/articles/55094-california-county-rejects-je-dunns-lone-bid-for-jail-project,18-Oct-22,"Officials in Santa Clara, Calif., voted Oct. 18 to seek a consultant to “refresh” the requirements for construction of a replacement county jail and to conduct community engagement rather than starting construction with the lone shortlisted contractor, JE Dunn Construction Co.

The Santa Clara Board of Supervisors initially approved a program to replace the county’s aging Main Jail North in 2016. Dunn was the only firm to submit a final proposal in response to a 2020 RFP to build a replacement jail.

That plan languished, but when officials began moving again this year to replace the jail, Santa Clara staff re-engaged Dunn to continue working off the prior response, Paul Neidlein, president of Dunn, said via email.

In May, Dunn submitted an updated design-build proposal for a 286,374-sq-ft secured treatment center with more space for programs and medical and mental health services than the current facility, county records show. 

“We all put a considerable amount of time and effort into working closely together to develop a cost-effective approach to the design and construction of the facility that incorporated scope changes,” Neidlein said.

The result was a 100% schematic design and detailed pricing.

County staff had recommended the board of supervisors award a $533.8-million contract to Dunn for the project rather than re-soliciting proposals, noting the volatility of the construction market, records show. However, county supervisors raised concerns about costs and local criminal justice reform advocates opposed the plan. Critics of the plan also raised the issue of Dunn’s  past employee disputes and its advocacy, as an employer that provides medical benefits to its staff, in the 2014 U.S. Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby birth control case.

Months of Delay

County supervisors tabled the issue for several months. By October, the Dunn contract was no longer included as an option for county officials, who opted instead to study the plan. 

“I remain opposed to any capital work on any kind of jail occurring prior to the build out of a continuum of care for mental health and substance use disorder treatments,” County Supervisor Susan Ellenberg said.

The consultant’s work will include advising the county on an acquisition strategy for design and construction, plus identifying correctional construction firms.

Supervisor: Existing Jail is Inhumane

County officials did not say how long they expect the process to take, but the county supervisor expressed concern about living conditions in the existing jail during the now-prolonged plan of a replacement. 

“Until we get an RFQ and design and public input and funding—and a majority of our successors don’t stop that project again—those individuals in that jail will be living in inhumane conditions,” outgoing County Supervisor Mike Wasserman said.

By the time the county actually goes to bid the new jail, he added, ""it will cost more money than it would cost now.”

Neidlein said Dunn had not yet decided whether it would bid for the project again.",1,0,0,0

2022-08-11,"Judge Declares Mistrial in Flint Water Case Against Engineers Veolia, LAN",https://www.enr.com/articles/54601-judge-declares-mistrial-in-flint-water-case-against-engineers-veolia-lan,11-Aug-22,"A jury tasked with finding whether two engineering firms that worked for Flint, Mich., are partially to blame for the city's lead-tainted drinking water crisis in 2014 and 2015 was unable to reach a unanimous decision, prompting a judge to declare a mistrial on Aug. 11 in what was seen as a bellwether case.

Veolia North America and Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam Inc., were accused of negligence and breach of the standard of professional care in their work for the city. The plaintiffs said the engineering firms failed to prevent corrosive water from causing lead to leach from pipes into drinking water systems, alleging that drinking the water caused neuro-cognitive injuries in four children.

The engineers said lead issues at the water treatment plant were out of the scope of their work for the city. They argued that city and state officials were actually to blame, claiming they had ignored the firms' recommendations that could have prevented or sooner identified the problem. The case was expected to serve as an indicator of whether engineering firms could face further liability for other injuries related to the tainted water.

Federal Magistrate Judge David Grand declared a mistrial in the case against Boston-based Veolia and Houston-based LAN, a unit of Leo A Daly, in U.S. District Court in Ann Arbor, Mich., after jurors said they would be unable to reach an agreement. 

“I believe that the jury has made clear that they are hopelessly deadlocked after a valiant effort to reach a unanimous verdict,” Grand said. 

The decision followed a nearly five-month-long trial and weeks of deliberations. In a note to Judge Grand, who was handling the case after U.S. District Judge Judith Levy stepped away due to a medical issue, jurors wrote that they did not believe they could continue deliberations “for the physical and emotional health of the jurors.”

They said that “Further deliberations will only result in stress and anxiety with no unanimous decision without someone having to surrender their honest convictions solely for the purpose of returning a verdict.”

Moshe Maimon, an attorney representing the families of children who allegedly suffered neuro-cognitive injuries as a result of drinking lead-tainted water, asked Grand to interview jurors individually about the case and what physical or mental health issues they were facing by continuing to deliberate, citing cases that dealt with jurors who were mentally or emotionally unstable. He asked Grand to consider a verdict based on the agreement of seven-of-eight jurors, rather than a unanimous verdict. 

Attorneys for Veolia and LAN requested a mistrial based on the jury’s note. Cheryl Bush, representing Veolia, and Wayne Mason, for LAN, said federal court rules require a unanimous verdict, and court instructions to jurors also specified that they were tasked with reaching a unanimous verdict. Asking anything else of jurors would be “totally inappropriate,” Mason told the judge. 

This was not the first time jurors on this case shared that they were having difficulty reaching a verdict. Grand said jurors had previously sent notes while Levy was still presiding over the case and again once he had taken over, and were instructed to continue deliberating. The district court released the notes to the public.

The judge added that questioning jurors individually would put them under “undue pressure,” and that the notes indicated the lack of consensus did not seem to be a single-juror issue.

“I find that if I were to have them deliberate any further, question them any further, it would improperly influence the jury, and result in an outcome that did not truly reflect the will of this jury,” Grand said.

Mason thanked the jurors for their service and said the deadlocked jury was the result of the plaintiffs being unable to meet their burden of proof in the case. ""The fact that the plaintiffs could not make their case to this jury underscores what the state’s own investigation found: there was an epic failure of government,"" he said in a statement. 

Flint's drinking water crisis began after the city switched its water source from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Dept. to the Flint River in April 2014 as a cost-saving measure. The city's water treatment plant was unable to prevent corrosive water from reaching lead pipes, causing lead to leach into drinking water.

The two firms were not part of the earlier $625-million state settlement related to Flint’s lead water contamination and its resulting problems. This suit was to be a bellwether case potentially determining the engineers’ liability for others impacted by the contaminated water.

LAN had worked for Flint prior to the source switch, but its work did not include treatment plant operations. LAN employees testified that they had recommended corrosion controls such as orthophosphate.

Flint later hired Veolia in 2015 to review issues at its water treatment plant other than lead, and its employees also said they recommended a corrosion control study which would have revealed the need to address the issue. Attorneys representing the firms argued that officials had dismissed recommendations because they were focused on saving money, as the city's finances were under review by a series of state-appointed emergency managers the entire time the firms were employed as consultants. ",1,0,0,0
2022-07-21,Hawaii Regulators Reject Navy Plan to Drain Leaking Fuel Storage Site,https://www.enr.com/articles/54478-hawaii-regulators-reject-navy-plan-to-drain-leaking-fuel-storage-site,21-Jul-22,"Hawaii’s Dept of Health says it will reject the U.S. Navy’s plan to remove millions of gallons of jet fuel from the Red Hill bulk fuel storage facility, a massive underground tank complex on Oahu where a 19,000-gallon spill last November contaminated a nearby water supply well serving 93,000 residents.

Leaders of the agency, which holds permitting authority over the World War II-era facility located 100 ft above the island’s primary drinking water aquifer, told a July 19 hearing of state legislators that the defueling plan lacked detail in several key areas. The Navy’s plan, released on June 30,  targets 2024 for  completion of the process.

“The highly anticipated defueling plan was disappointing,” said Kathy Ho, department deputy director of environmental health. She said the Navy had failed to address seven elements identified in a state-issued emergency order that halted operations at Red Hill earlier this year. 

Ho indicated that more information is needed on specific operational aspects, timelines, and other issues, as well as regulatory review time to ensure the operation to remove approximately 100 million gallons of fuel remaining at the facility is carried out as quickly as possible without further risk to Oahu’s citizens and environment. 

“We need the Navy to feel the same sense of urgency that we feel,” Ho said, adding that safely defueling and decommissioning Red Hill’s 20 12.5-million-gallon fuel tanks “will be in the best interests of everyone.”

Noting that the Navy understands department concerns, Rear Adm. Stephen Barnett, Navy Region Hawaii commander defended the plan to the legislators, calling it “a framework” to safely meet the deadline for defueling. He said many plan aspects were still in the design phase, but promised to submit a more detailed plan in September. Defueling operations cannot begin without state agency approval.

 

“Cascading failures”

Carved into a hillside overlooking Pearl Harbor during the early 1940s, Red Hill's tanks each are contains 250-ft-high, 100-ft-dia. steel-lined and encased in concrete. Three pipelines connect the tanks to fueling piers at Pearl Harbor via a 2.5-mile-long concrete tunnel.

Historical data compiled by the Sierra Club of Hawaii indicate that the facility has leaked at least 180,000 gallons of fuel over the past 80 years. A 27,000-gallon spill from a single tank in January 2014 led to a 20-year federal-state agreement to study ways to improve facility infrastructure and safeguard Oahu’s water supply from future fuel releases.

A Navy investigation determined that the November 2021 spill resulted from preventable “cascading failures” in training, response and incident followup that began six months earlier, when an improper fuel transfer inside a maintenance tunnel resulted in a pressure surge and rupture of two piping joints. 

On November 20, the Navy says, a tunnel vehicle inadvertently struck a valve on the pipeline, which had apparently sagged under the fuel’s weight. Although the Navy initially claimed less than 600 gallons of fuel was released and contained quickly with no impact to the drinking water system, the investigations found the spill actually unfolded over more than a day.

The Navy later found that nearly 20,000 gallons had poured into a PVC retention pipeline that is part of Red Hill’s fire suppression system. Some fuel spilled through a floor drain where sump pumps had activated, channeling it to a supply well for the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam water system.

Military families living near Red Hill soon began reporting detectable petroleum taste, odor and sheen in their water, as well as medical symptoms associated with consumption of contaminated water. More than 3,000 residents were forced from their homes. The department  placed the entire 93,000-user water system under a contamination advisory that remained in place for three months.

According to the Navy, about 4,700 gallons of fuel from the November spill remains in soil, rock, and water beneath the maintenance tunnel. Existing monitoring wells indicate no contamination in the aquifer, but the Navy says it is expanding the monitoring network and creating a groundwater capture zone to prevent migration of fuel away from the site.

 
Shaping a strategy

Earlier this year, the Navy commissioned engineering firm Simpson Gumpertz & Heger to lead an independent assessment of the Red Hill facility. Based on its recommendations, the Navy’s five-phase defueling strategy calls for both routine and operation-specific infrastructure repairs, installation of bypass lines and other work, much of which must be carried out while fuel remains in the tanks.

The longest phase of the plan—preparing and modifying existing system elements for defueling—is estimated to take 17 months to complete.

Fleet Civil Engineer Rear Adm. Dean VanderLey told state legislators that the additional repairs will “add resilience to the system,” such as increasing bracing of the lines to better withstand pressure during defueling.

The Navy’s plan recognizes that the specialized nature of the repairs could be affected by current supply chain issues, “as the materials and components are non-standard dimension piping uniquely manufactured for Red Hill and must be custom fabricated off-island.” Integrating design and construction processes, the plan adds, offers the best way to manage such long-lead items, “in order to identify unique components, including the materials and specifications, early in the execution of a contracts.”

Bennett added that as the scope of repairs comes into focus, the Navy will work with state and federal regulators to complete defueling sooner than the current plan’s December 2024 completion date.

“Where prudent and where possible, we will look for opportunities to definitely accelerate our timeline,” he said. “But we can’t do it at the cost of safety.”

In November, the Navy expects to deliver a plan for permanent closure of the facility, to be implemented after the defueling operation is complete.

Despite agency reservations on the current defueling plan, Ho expressed hope that the next version will provide sufficient detail to receive approval and allow defueling to move forward.

But, she added, the agency “will continue to hold the Navy accountable for the safe defueling of this pipeline as quickly as possible.",1,0,0,0

Most recent thinking on safety is based on ideas generally known as human and organizational performance—where it is assumed workers will make errors and the emphasis is on the work environment and processes to prevent severe injuries—rather than on disciplining workers who violate safety rules. This change is great news for workers and safety in general. But it isn’t going to be easy to change the construction industry, which could remain stuck with older ideas centered on strict discipline, termination for safety violations and preoccupation with lowering recordable injury rates. Balancing the new approach with the old could turn out to be a delicate art. We have some ideas about how  these new ideas on safety can be blended with the existing systems. But first we ought to assess the challenge.The new emphasis on human and organizational performance (HOP), also known as the “New View,” has been described as a “cross between system design and psychology” that relies on the social sciences to better understand how to design resilient systems that prevent severe injury. One of the assumptions is that when humans are involved, mistakes are inevitable. According to Andrea Baker, author of The HOP Mentor,  the goal is to design better systems—including rules and methods of discipline—to “improve system resilience to human error” and thereby reduce the consequences of such error. 

The goal is to design better systems, including rules and methods of discipline, to 'improve system resilience to human error.'Andrea Baker, The HOP Mentor

What happens after an incident or broken rule is important, too. An employee who believes she or he may be subject to disciplinary action is less likely to provide an employer the best, most complete information about what happened. In an attempt to ask better questions that go beyond the typical bias to identify errors and blame someone, some companies have reduced the use of disciplinary action—such as suspensions from work, or formal reprimands in the employment record—following safety-related incidents. In some cases, employers have taken discipline off the table completely to benefit the investigation.For manufacturers and other employers whose ability to obtain work does not depend on their safety record or adopting another company’s safety approach, the shift to human and organizational performance safety programs is largely uninhibited, at least as far as dealings with other companies. Internal naysayers, however, will challenge and ask why they can’t just get rid of the uninterested or unteachable bad apples on the staff and move on. But if high-level leaders embrace and drive the new approach, leaders at all levels will ultimately capitulate and may even find value in it.Construction is different. A contractor's business success depends on its ability and willingness to embrace its customers’ demands on health and safety—especially when it comes to the use of disciplining employees according to the severity of their rules violation and relying heavily on recordable injury rates. The rates have been shown to be an unreliable measure of success.  

Jeremy Presnal
Many clients choose not to implement the new ideas, relying instead on old-school principles of disciplining rule violators, zero-tolerance policies and measuring safety success in terms of recordable incident rates. In such cases, contractors will often find themselves obligated under their contracts to cling to old-school tactics rather than focusing on prevention of life-altering injuries and fatalities. Subcontractors have even more challenges, as their clients are in all cases contractors who will be bound by their own contractual requirements and who live and die, from a business standpoint, on recordable injury rates.While all contractual terms are theoretically negotiable, to successfully run a business, many contractors and subcontractors capitulate to most or all client requirements even if contrary to human and organizational performance ideas and other modern approaches to occupational safety.  

Travis Livermore
Even if customers have moved to an approach based on the New Thinking, they may deem contractors not worth the effort or incapable of implementing the new ideas. Alternatively, the customers may view the implementation on a construction project, which is far more short-lived than their ongoing business, as too risky. In other words, their perspective may be that there is no time to sculpt a workforce and the systems under which it operates, and resort instead to the old idea that bad apples should be identified and eliminated as soon as possible.Short-term workforces pose other problems. Managers may feel that there is no time to take a human and organizational performance approach and that allowing employees to remain on site after they have violated rules, such as those requiring 100% tie-off while working at heights, is just too precarious. Clients may demand termination or some other form of severe disciplinary action following any incident.  Those are the challenges. Human and organizational performance ideas have produced radical changes in the mindset of many environmental health and safety professionals and other company managers. And while the obstacles to enacting the New View may seem high, they are not insurmountable.The second part of this two-part series will describe the problems created by OSHA and some solutions that involve construction contracts.",1,0,0,0
2022-05-26,Firms Formulate Strategies to Reduce Industry Suicide Rates,https://www.enr.com/articles/54183-firms-formulate-strategies-to-reduce-industry-suicide-rates,26-May-22,"Boosting peer-to-peer support is critical in reducing the construction industry’s high suicide rate, said mental health advocates at the Construction Working Minds Summit, held May 17-18 in Denver. Around 200 attendees exchanged strategies to foster psychological safety at jobsites, similar to how the industry has spent decades improving physical safety.

“We view this as a safety issue, and we’ve completely changed our culture,” said Jon Kinning, COO of RK Industries. In addition to prevention training and toolbox talks, RK implemented a leave-of-absence policy that includes mental health and aligned its employee assistance program with mental health providers so that all are in network. As a result, 20 suicides have been averted, he said.

Conference attendee Melanie Leonard, an HR director for Yeh and Associates, said “the light bulb went off hearing about how one of the panelists had actually put mental health resources into their onboarding package, and how important that has been for retention at their organization.”

“We are in a historic movement” of “getting together and getting organized,” said conference co-organizer Sally Spencer-Thomas, who also provided in-depth daylong “train-the-trainer” sessions to 33 participants. These trainers will return to their companies and hold training sessions with safety staff and other field personnel who will then disseminate suicide prevention support to their jobsites.

Trainee Dan Lester, director of field diversity, inclusion and culture at Clayco, aims to instruct psychological safety ambassadors who will create “a community inside our organization” that can provide interim care similar to CPR until the at-risk person can meet with a certified health provider.",1,3,0,0

Women in the construction sector are anxious to tackle the challenges of the industry’s post-pandemic recovery—leading forays into major new growth markets and launching creative approaches to current workplace transitions and the still nagging problem of employee and business diversity.Impacts of workplace change brought on by the pandemic were a key topic for the more than 700 industry attendees at the Groundbreaking Women in Construction conference, sponsored by ENR and construction law firm Peckar & Abramson and held live in San Francisco, May 11-12.Andra Kidd, chief operating officer of engineer Verdantas, shared new data from a broader business workplace survey by research consultant Employee Engagement Group, indicating that only 17% of respondents said all employees had returned to an office or field site full-time, with 30% reporting that only one-quarter of staff had done so.About 36% of survey respondents said they will continue to offer “unlimited flexibility” if jobs allow for it, while just 5.7% have made on-site work required, Kidd said, adding that 29% have allowed employees to choose “core days” for office work versus 11.4% that have management deciding.About 51% of GWIC attendee respondents said in an instant poll that their workplaces now have a hybrid office-remote work arrangement. The conference, held live May 11-12 for the first time in three years, drew more than 700 industry attendees in San Francisco.

About 32% of attendees said women will fall behind in their careers with new hybrid work models many employers are adopting, though half believed they would thrive in the adapted work environment.“I formalized working from home for my company,” said Bisa Grant, CEO of Anchor, a California construction management firm. She emphasized that “full engagement is not where you’re working, but that work is getting done,” and urged attendees to “make sure you’re on top of things."" Jazleen Aguilar, marketing manager for Colorado mechanical contractor Murphy Co., said women need to “step up” use of work processes “never done before” and not to avoid asking the same kinds of questions when working remotely as they would on site.Lauren Ruth Martin, a Tennessee-based workplace burnout therapist and owner of Novel Consulting, said the pandemic has “amplified"" the need for employee services. “Burnout is an issue of bandwidth” and “can evolve into a diagnosable mental health condition if it goes unaddressed,” she said, urging attendees to adopt the workplace mindset of “humbleswagger,” which she defined as “remaining confident in your strengths while acknowledging that we are all fallible.” Agility is the WordEven as women seek new ways to adapt to the changing workplace, the quickening pace of the post-pandemic market is opening new design and construction arenas for demonstrated leadership potential.Gretchen Gagel, CEO of Greatness Consulting, shared her research on what makes organizations “agile”—able to adapt again and again to new conditions. “As leaders, we need to be able to deal with changes in our business context and to lead through that,” she said.Sonia Lopez, a preconstruction executive at contractor DPR, joked that while the firm “didn’t know there was going to be a pandemic … we were working on how to prepare for the next thing,” so it had ramped up hiring in the two years prior. “When this did happen, we already had a team in place and dashboards to show clients how to tackle supply chain,” she said.In a large organization such as the U.S. General Services Administration, which builds and manages federal government facilities, turning the ship is not that easy, said Julia De Rosi, a deputy assistant commissioner, but new technology enabled a pivot to virtual project inspections. While such agility is a “short-term response” to the pandemic, it also allowed GSA to gain longer-term operational and strategic value. “We are not just working in the business anymore, we are working on the business,” she said. “It was really transformative for GSA.”Global beverage giant AB InBev realized that it could be “more agile than we thought we could be and that was really through the empowerment of frontline workers,” said Carolina Pallaro, its global director of engineering and projects execution.The firm decided to build a permanent 100-bed hospital in Brazil—approved by management in three days leading to a collaboration with a modular contractor and a hospital chain. Built in just 33 days, the project spurred others in Ecuador and Peru, and generated a tool kit for future use. “The challenge for us as construction leaders is how we foster this same sense of purpose in our normal business,” said Pallaro. Sky's No Longer the LimitNancy Bray, director of spaceport integration and services for NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, pointed to women in high-profile positions in its current and future project execution—including the Artemis program, which will land the first woman and first person of color on the moon.Maria Lehman, incoming American Society of Civil Engineers president (second from left), told GWIC attendees that it's important for girls to see themselves developing careers as construction sector professions.
Photo: Scott Blair/ENRAn organizational chart she displayed during an address entitled, “The Sky’s No Longer the Limit,” showed that women now hold half of the spaceport’s 22 leadership roles. They include Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA's first woman launch director, who will oversee countdown and liftoff of the Artemis rocket and spacecraft test flight this year.“We’ve got to keep encouraging young girls and get them excited at the elementary [school] age,” Bray said. Pressure on the PipelineIndustry veterans outlined the challenges of building the workforce pipeline, offering insights on how to advance careers for next-gen women and men.Maria Lehman, an executive of engineer GHD and incoming president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, noted that “It’s important for girls to see themselves in the profession,” pointing out that 70% of women engineers leave the field within 20 years. “There are not enough white men to do the work we need to do,” she added.Henry Nutt III, a Black former union sheet metal worker wno now is a preconstruction executive at Southland Industries and chair of the Associated General Contractors’ national diversity and inclusion steering committee, said “We have to monitor and enforce change … not to penalize, but to hold [industry] accountable.”Caryn Halifax, CEO of the International Masonry Institute, the bricklayers' union training arm, underscored efforts to promote industry work early to students as a viable career option, emphasizing that school counselors ""are not incentivized to push people to non traditional occupations."" Also an ACE Mentor program national board member, she said the organization provides $2.5 million in annual scholarships to industry prospects.""We really need to understand that we have to bring everyone to the table early,"" said Agnes Weber, a TRC Cos. senior vice president with 37 years of experience in public and private sector construction management. ""They need to experience good and bad situations. We want people to fail softly. That's how you learn."" Lara Poloni, global president of AECOM and a 30-year industry engineering veteran, emphasized in career anecdotes that the key to leadership impact is as much tied to empathy and trusting one’s instinct. Women often feel they have to be “super-assertive and speak with force,” she said. “I disagree.”Another lesson, she said, is “start with 'yes.’” When ultimately offered a C-suite position at AECOM, Poloni initially balked, saying she felt she wasn’t ready. Poloni urged attendees to “say 'yes,' work backward from there and figure out how to make it work.”As part of an environmental, social and governance strategy announced last year, AECOM has targeted women to make up at least 20% of its senior leadership and at least 35% of its workforce “near term."" The program also ties leadership ESG accountability on projects through annual audits of specific performance targets. “We also take a look every year” at women’s salaries, said Poloni, and “if adjustments are needed, we make them.” Power Plays For WomenEmphasizing the strong career potential for AEC trade and technical professionals in dynamic clean energy sectors such as offshore wind and solar power, respectively, Alla Weinstein, founder and CEO of project developers Trident Winds and Castle Winds, and SOLV Energy business development manager Alison Adams updated GWIC attendees on opportunities for talent as the fossil-fuel transition accelerates.Touting California’s just announced state draft plan for 3 GW of floating offshore wind by 2030, and up to 15 GW by 2045, Weinstein, an industry pioneer, detailed the early challenges she faced to gain any U.S. support. She now has major floating wind energy development projects proposed in California and Washington state.“You kind of have to look beyond the horizon to realize that things might not happen today, it may take you 10 years before you can see reality,” she said.SOLV Energy, formed last year from Swinerton Construction's spinoff of its clean-energy building business, is one of the largest U.S. solar sector constructors. ""One thing that I love about this industry is that it’s at the intersection of so many things,” said Adams. Solar is ""incredibly flexible, we can put it in lots of places, pretty much anywhere that the sun shines. I think this is one thing that gives so much opportunity for women.” Infrastructure Investment: Spurring DiversityThe $1.2-trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  is an anticipated vehicle to propel solutions and funding to address diversity imbalances in AEC staffing and projects, said Giovanna Brasfield, CEO of Brasfield & Associates, an industry DEI and training consultant.Rhianna Rogers, a RAND Center policy researcher, questioned whether the law's broadband investment, with a $100-million allotment compared to billions for other infrastructure sectors, needs a boost as a key link to stakeholders, particularly in environmental justice communities.With the administration’s focus on underserved communities, new funding will uniquely position AEC firms to monitor and improve how public works projects impact them, said Bridget Ssamula, a senior director of AECOM, pointing to integration of qualitative geodata into project planning. Tracking project performance through quantifiable metrics to create accountability can lead to meaningful change in underserved communities, she said.“Firms can use data to pinpoint exactly how a project will impact a surrounding area and add human equity back in,” said Ssamula.“These are the places, when we are talking about climate risk and climate impacts, that bear the brunt of these decisions,” said Allison Brooks, executive director of the Bay Area Regional Collaborative (BARC), a group of seven San Francisco Bay Area government agencies.The multibillion-dollar expansion and upgrade of Terminal 8 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, N.Y., spurred owner American Airlines and key contractor Holt Construction to customize a program of extended outreach to boost involvement of businesses owned by minorities and women, and local firms. It included mentoring for firms that did not pass prequalification hurdles, to improve their future options, said Alexandria Perotti, a Holt director.Often, diversity efforts are perfunctory, where “you put up a flyer,” said Oby Chiapa, operations manager with Group PMX, which assisted in the effort.The process resulted in engaging more than 200 new firms, 125 subcontracts issued, and 225 mentoring sessions offered to 5,500 attendees over two years, with subcontracting goals exceeded, said Asmita Gharat, American’s project manager. Industry's Emerging Arenas Attendees also gained insights on the unique legal and cultural nuances of project development on Indian-owned lands, as tribes, with more than 600 federally recognized, seeking to expand revenue potential. More government-backed projects also are eyed by the administration, with significant new federal funding earmarked for infrastructure and community improvement.“Tribes want you to do your homework before you start working with them,” said Pilar Thomas, a partner at law firm Quarles & Brady and a former Indian affairs official in the U.S. Interior and Energy Depts. While she termed gaming-related development on indigenous lands “an anchor of economic and infrastructure development for tribes” since a 1988 federal law enabled it, Thomas pointed to the added complexity of project and contract approval because of tribes’ sovereign status.Tahda Ahtone, an attorney and Arizona-based developer on tribal lands, added that while tribal lands have key tax exemptions, she urged industry professionals to clearly understand the intricacies of land ownership“Tribes are not low-hanging fruit,” said Kari McCormick, client services director at Wenaha Group, a development consultant and PM for indigenous projects. She pointed to needed inclusion of tribal member workforce preferences that will “ build community after you’re gone.” Such outreach can offer “rewards tenfold” in building longer-term project relationships.With significant climate change impacts intensifying, next-generation industry talent will be critical in developing and implementing solutions, particularly in revamped and reimagined water infrastructure in the face of widening drought conditions, said Newsha Ajami, a PhD civil engineer who is chief researcher in earth and environmental sciences at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.""We are living with the consequences of infrastructure built 100 years ago, a top down rigid system,"" she told the GWIC audience. ""We have to rethink our model and extend our idea of what infrastructure is. We design for certainty and nature is very uncertain.""Ajami emphasized that ""we need a lot of diverse ideas at the table,"" noting that ""60% of the world's cities have not yet been built.""

2022-05-11,$624M Design-Build Contract Marks Alabama's First Step to Fix Problem Prisons,https://www.enr.com/articles/54097-624m-design-build-contract-marks-alabamas-first-step-to-fix-problem-prisons,11-May-22,"In an important step toward upgrading unsafe conditions throughout its prison system, the state of Alabama has awarded Caddell Construction Co. a $623.6-million design-build contract for a 4,000-bed ""megaprison.""

The Elmore County project is the first of two 4,000-bed men’s prisons Alabama officials are planning to build. State officials signed the contract for the work with the Montgomery, Ala.-based firm effective April 15.

The future prison will provide enhanced medical and mental health services, says Gina Maiola, a spokesperson for Gov. Kay Ivey. The prison-building program follows a 2020 U.S. Dept. of Justice lawsuit filed against Alabama that alleged an investigation had uncovered unsafe and unsanitary conditions inside state prisons.

“The new facility will create a safer security environment for inmates and security personnel,” Maiola says.

Caddell Construction didn’t respond to requests for comment on the project, but it has previously worked on a variety of other corrections facility design-build projects, including a U.S. penitentiary in Beaumont, Texas, and a county jail in Florida that it completed last year. Caddell ranks No. 111 on ENR’s 2021 Top 400 Contractors list with $815 million in revenue the year before. 

In addition to building the two new men’s prisons in Elmore and Escambia counties, Alabama has plans to build a smaller women’s prison and renovate several other existing prisons as part of a $1.3-billion program. As ENR previously reported, Ivey signed a bill package last fall to issue $785 million in bonds and allocate $150 million from the state’s general fund to pay for the work. Controversially, it also set aside about $400 million in federal COVID-19 relief money for the prison projects.

Construction is expected to take about three years. Maiola says the timeline remains on schedule.",1,0,0,0
2022-03-17,VA Proposes to Reshape Its Vast Health Care Facility Portfolio,https://www.enr.com/articles/53806-va-proposes-to-reshape-its-vast-health-care-facility-portfolio,17-Mar-22,"The US Dept. of Veterans Affairs has proposed a wide-ranging blueprint to revamp its sprawling network of hundreds of health care facilities that would involve many new construction projects and result in a net increase in the number of multi-purpose outpatient clinics but a slight net decrease in the number of VA hospitals.

The VA Asset and Infrastructure Review recommendations, released on March 14, mark the beginning of a long deliberative process, similar to the US Defense Dept.’s Base Realignment and Closure program, which included five rounds of shutdowns—but also some base expansions—from 1988 to 2005.

The program was mandated in a 2018 statute for VA, which operates 171 medical facilities and more than 1,000 centers for outpatient care, which it says makes it the largest integrated health care system in the U.S.

VA's recommendations for new construction, upgrades, reconfigurations and closures respond to several trends, including more veterans who live in many parts of the South and West and fewer in the northeast and midwest, a VA spokesman said.

The condition of VA facilities is another factor. In the report, VA Secretary Denis McDonough said the proposal would replace “old, outdated, run-down facilities with state-of-the-art facilities designed with veterans and VA employees in mind.”

The median age of facilities is nearly 60 years, compared with a median of 8.5 years for U.S. hospitals in the private sector. About 69% of VA hospitals exceed 50 years, says the report.

A major shift in how health care is provided also drives the recommendations. “Many VA hospitals were built in a time when inpatient care, not outpatient care was predominant—a trend that has since flipped as medical advancements have allowed veterans to recover at home,” McDonough said.

The report adds that “innovation in telehealth has helped bring medical expertise directly into veterans’ homes and other convenient locations, further diminishing reliance on in-person visits.”

If the proposal is carried out as proposed, the net number of VA hospitals would dip to 168, from 171 now. It would include constructing some new hospitals, including facilities in Phoenix; Newport News and Norfolk, Va., and San Antonio, Texas.

The number of “multi-specialty"" outpatient clinics would jump by 56%, to a net 388, from 248. Those clinics provide primary care, as well as mental health and other specialty care services.

Community living centers also would increase, to a net 29, from just two now.

There would be fewer community outpatient clinics, with the net number set to fall 15%, to 469, from 555. Those facilities provide primary care on site, and mental health care services on site or via telehealth. They may also have pharmacy services.

The US Army Corps of Engineers would be the lead federal agency for VA projects valued at $100 million or more, which would appear to include all of the 14 new hospitals VA is proposing, said Brian Turmail, Associated General Contractors of America vice president for public affairs and strategic initiatives. The entire program ""would certainly be in the billions for construction."" he said in an email to ENR.

A commission nominated by President Joe Biden will review the VA recommendations, a process that will include public hearings. Former Pennsylvania Congressman Patrick Murphy (D) was nominated on March 9 as panel chair, with seven other members also nominated.

The commission, which can make changes in the VA plan, must submit recommendations to the President by Jan. 31, 2023. The President then will submit to Congress and the commission by Feb. 15, his approval or disapproval of panel recommendations. Congress has 45 days to draw up and act on a resolution disapproving the recommendations. If such a resolution fails to pass, the plan will go forward.

VA then has up to three years to begin to implement the plan. ""During the implementation, VA would develop a process for prioritization and funding of projects."" He added, ""It is too early to know how long it will take to complete the recommendations,"" the VA spokesman said.

Communities that would lose VA facilities under the proposal are expected to mount campaigns to reverse those recommendations, as will their congressional delegations.

One early signal came from Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman John Tester (D-Mont.), whose state would lose a VA nursing home and two clinics under the VA proposal. ""As I’ve said in the past, any effort to kneecap our veterans’ health care is a non-starter for me,"" he said in a statement. ""I will fight tooth and nail against any proposals that blindly look to reduce access to VA care or put our veterans at a disadvantage.”

Story changed on 3/22/2022 to correct errors in some of the net changes in types of facilities resulting from the plan.

Learning to build successful teams, advocate for new technologies, communicate effectively and adapt to market realities are critical skills that young construction industry professionals need to advance careers, said participants at ENR’s Top Young Professionals Conference.Robert Penney, Skanska USA's national director of continuous improvement, shared at the event, held in Tempe, Ariz., on Feb. 24-25, his “secret sauce” for building high-performing project teams. “We know high-performing teams are possible—we’ve all been on them,” he said. “But how can we consistently replicate them?”  Rather than replicate the team itself, “we standardize the creation of the team,” Penny suggested. ""High-performing project teams are built on trust, transparency and communication—the foundations for how to collaborate as a team.” The structure, he adds, “is an aligned vision of success.”Team members have accountability and engagement and are motivated individually and collectively, he noted. Because a project team works over time, it needs a system for operational excellence that involves clarity of process and a culture of continuous improvement.Penny also tapped a panel of speakers to discuss team success by building “harmony, not homogeny.”Tupac de la Cruz, founder and operations manager at contractor Roofing Solutions, noted challenges of meeting benchmarks with four different generations in the workforce that all have different styles of communicating, from “email to texting to snap chat.” Nicole Brown, an associate vice president of AECOM, used a music metaphor for project team success, since an array of musicians come together to create a single musical performance. “Everyone has their own part to play, but the job of the team is to understand the music we are playing."" she said. ""What’s our goal? You don’t scat during Handel’s Messiah!”Nick Martinez, an Ironworkers Local 433 member and general field superintendent for Red Cedar Steel, said that for a large automotive building project in the Phoenix area on which he is working, maintaining a harmonious team requires tapping every option to keep staffing at required levels.“We are bringing in workers from every location possible—everyone is from somewhere else with all kinds of attitudes,” he said, “But we have to put them together and make sure we can work safely with multiple cranes six to seven days a week and meet a schedule that has already been committed to.”

Finding A Group
Finding one’s footing when joining the workforce—regardless of industry—can be daunting. First-generation Bechtel Corp. employees Isabel Siordia and Valentin Martinez, who identify as Latinx, discussed how Business Resource Groups (BRGs) help young minority workers adjust to the AEC industry.With the added complexity of joining the industry during the pandemic, Siordia, a construction engineer for Bechtel Equipment Operations, said that employee groups organized around commonalities such as ethnicity, gender and age accelerate diversity, inclusion and business change.Siordia said the company BRG has increased her visibility at the firm and at conferences. Aside from improving her leadership skills and providing access to senior management, she also said it has helped her tackle a fear of “public speaking, as you can see.”Project controls engineer Martinez said BRGs improve employee morale, mental health and performance. “Not only is it beneficial for the employee but it also benefits the company,” he said.Martinez also said the BRG gave him the confidence to help peers who were nervous about transitioning from Microsoft Excel to Microsoft Power BI, an interactive data visualization software. “They were very appreciative when I was sitting down with them to say, ‘This is how you build a data sheet,’” he said. “That gave them the encouragement to go use this tool.” Advocate for Tech Even the smallest technology adoptions can have a big impact on safety and productivity, and young leaders are among those in the industry driving their adoption and use. Ankur Podder, research engineer at the US Energy Dept,'s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and Michael Giacco, director of technology at AI Engineers Inc., presented real-world findings about adopting cutting edge technology at jobsites—including drones, additive manufacturing, 4D planning software and digital twins.These all serve a role in addressing big picture problems such as climate change resilience and reducing carbon emissions. But firms must avoid “innovation for innovation’s sake,” said Giacco.Podder said his lab helps industry “understand what’s next in a pragmatic way” by collaborating to “understand where they are at now, what they need and how they can push forward.”Going beyond simply deploying drones to inspect multi-story buildings for retrofits, his team has tested material-spraying drones to avoid erecting scaffolding that can lead to accidents. “That’s the ‘what’s next,’” Podder said. “We work with entities in the space to see if there’s funding or demonstrations where we can work together and prove this out.”Podder also tries to poke holes in conventional industry wisdom, such as that offsite fabrication and modular construction are widely considered to be more productive because of controlled environments. “That’s where we come in to really understand if their final projects are better quality,"" he said. ""You are delivering faster but are they more energy efficient at the end of the day?”Giacco encouraged young professionals to convince their firms to adopt more technology.“You need to spend a lot of time crafting your rhyme behind the reason for bringing technology to management and why this will be useful. Practicality is a big thing,” he said. “You can’t do tech for tech’s sake. Get your pitch straight, your elevator speech correct and focus on ground work. Take baby steps.”One conference participant, acknowledging that drones are easily justified for inspecting large-scale bridges with difficult access areas, asked how they can be justified to inspect smaller bridges such as single span structures.Giacco pointed out that using a drone avoids using equipment such as snoopers or having to arrange a police detail and closing a lane of traffic. “You can fly the drone underneath the bridge to inspect it without any of those added efforts that are less safe,” he said, adding  that people tend to “let their guard down” during routine inspections. “Now what is mundane suddenly becomes dangerous,” he said. “This technology will help you mitigate that situation.”Giacco said that use of aerial mounted ground penetrating radar on a drone to inspect underground utilities is five to six years away as a “pinpointed beam to look beyond the curtain.” He said he recently saw this technology firsthand, which was the “first indication that we will have something unique that will allow us to do something we haven’t done in the industry before.”

Infrastructure Act Unknowns 
Young professionals also gained a sense of the challenges in rolling out new project funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the $1.2-trillion law enacted last year.Funds are flowing to states in a “very piecemeal fashion” with “fairly slow” guidance from the U.S. Dept. of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, said Gregory D. Byres, deputy director for transportation and state engineer at the Arizona Dept. of Transportation.

Gregory D. Byres, Deputy Director, Arizona Dept. of Transportation
States are running under a continuous resolution rather than a defined budget, Byres explained. Stakeholders don’t know how much and when the funding will reach states.“Most things we just don't know. We're hoping there will be in the next couple weeks, another continuing resolution, [then] we'll start to see a little bit more on the funding side,” he said. “Once that funding does start to kick in, we'll start seeing a little bit more of the rule making.”Timing is one major issue facing state DOTs. Half of the fiscal year is already gone, but the new funding must be spent within the fiscal year—and those funds are not yet on hand.“One of the things that’s starting to scare me more than anything else is if we get these dollars very, very late in the year,” Byres said, is whether the industry will have capacity “to be able to fulfill the projects that we’re going to put out.” The state DOT will focus on trying to distribute work statewide as much as possible. “If we saturate the market to the point that we’re driving costs up, then it’s not worth it for all of us,"" he said.The law is broken into two separate categories: formula funding, which is guaranteed funding to each of the states based on population and other factors, and discretionary funding, which will be the larger part of the package.“The formula funding is guaranteed dollars to the state,"" Byres said. ""For the state of Arizona, we're looking at an additional $200 million in FY 22.” .Arizona must also contend with its booming economy and with state dollars at historical levels, which adds to the complexity of figuring out how to roll out so much work with finite resources.Byres noted more state dollars than ""what we're getting at the federal level."" He said that “with the state dollars flowing in, that gives us a bonding capacity to actually even double or triple what we can possibly do. It also gives us the ability to delay projects and ... a little bit more room on how we can deliver those projects.”Arizona DOT's five year program for FY22-FY27 is the largest in agency history. In FY26 and FY27 alone, there is more than $800 million just for transportation, Byres explained.He added that the funding has sub-allocations for major municipalities, planning organizations, non-profit groups and councils of government across state.“We don't know how much we're going to have to give up to those NPOs and municipalities,” Byres said. “Best guess that we have is about 30% to 50% of the funds coming into the state will get sub-allocated.”His agency will focus on trying to distribute work statewide as much as possible. “If we saturate the market to the point that we're driving costs up, then it's not worth it for all of us,” Byres said. More Challenges AheadInfrastructure work will also compete with the private sector, he added, pointing to the planned $12-billion Taiwan Semiconductor factory under way in Chandler, Ariz.""It's so large that it is becoming difficult to find iron workers because they they're getting sucked up in that one project,” Byres explained. “The first time I saw it, I thought somebody had opened up a new crane supply or rental company, because there were probably 40 or 50 cranes on that site. When you have that going on within the state, that's something else that we're competing against as well.”Many conference attendees shared that their firms are already preparing for an influx in public infrastructure work.With Congress developing a new national renewable energy standard that requires utilities to generate a specific portion of power from renewable sources, the time is ripe for engineers to innovate in the carbon-cutting economy, said Nooshin Behroyan, CEO of the California-based professional services firm, Paxon Energy and Infrastructure Services.“As engineers, it is crucial that we come up with innovative approaches, because we are collectively moving the industry forward.” she said.But when it comes to building for climate change resilience, Behroyan stressed that the construction industry isn’t moving fast enough and engineers have a responsibility to help push clients in a sustainable direction.“Climate change is not linear, it’s exponential; meaning that the worse it gets, the faster it goes,” she explained. Therefore, there is a booming opportunity in the carbon-cutting economy for engineers who can create “net positive solutions” within their scope of work, she said.

Sizemore
From climate change to the industry’s mental health crisis to its need for diversity, equity and inclusion, the urgency for industry change was a dominant theme of a joint conference of the Construction Users Roundtable and the Construction Industry Institute Feb. 7-9 in Orlando. The importance of technology, asset sustainability, supply chain and estimating, power (how to build trust despite master-servant relationships), safety, and attracting and retaining people were the top emerging issues identified by presenter Gretchen Gagel, president and CEO of Greatness Consulting, based on the 2022 Owner Study she conducted sponsored by CURT and CII. Despite a number of success stories mentioned in the study, respondents rated industry DEI at only an average of 1.85 on a scale of 1 to 4. By comparison, respondents gave the industry a 3.1 rating on its “agility in reacting to the pandemic.”Gagel also related her study to data showing the number of suicides in the construction industry to be an estimated four-to-five times that of the number of jobsite fatalities— another huge challenge for the industry, she noted. Gagel pitched audience members that they could be “the hero or heroine” of this story—by “coming together to forge powerful solutions that engage all stakeholders. The time for change is now.”For this year’s survey, to achieve a “more holistic idea of what was happening” in the industry, Gagel expanded her data set beyond the 24 owners interviewed in previous studies to include representatives of 12 large A/E/C firm representatives as well as eight influencers.Source: CURT/CII 2022 Owner StudyFor Now, No Formal AllianceAt the same time, CURT and CII, who had been exploring their own changes with the proposed formation of an alliance for research purposes, didn’t address the topic during the three-day meeting, although it previously had been on the agenda.Greg Sizemore, CURT executive vice president, had updated members via email on Jan. 21 to explain that the University of Texas at Austin “instructed the Construction Industry Institute to terminate planning of the member-supported alliance between CII and CURT.” CII is based at the University of Texas.
Nevertheless, Sizemore’s email added, “It is obvious to us that the spirit of the alliance prevails. CURT will continue to pursue the concept of an alliance.”CURT and CII—along with the Engineering and Construction Contracting Association—announced in September 2020 “their intention to form an alliance to provide more resources and reduce overall costs to members,” according to an ENR story that fall. More recently, the prospect of the alliance had focused on CURT and CII collaborations.In an email statement to ENR, John G. Ekerdt, associate dean for research in engineering at the UT, noted that “CII’s governance through the University of Texas at Austin would not allow the alliance to be structured as it was proposed. The two organizations, CII and CURT, intend to look for ways to cooperate as they continue on their missions to improve the construction industry.”Stephen Mulva, director of CII, told ENR in a follow-up interview, “It’s important for CII to continue to collaborate with CURT and with other groups.”",1,1,0,0

On Sept 15, 2020, a strong tropical storm neared the Gulf Coast of Florida and appeared to be heading for a landfall in Alabama. In Florida’s westernmost city, Pensacola, contractor Skanska had partly finished, and traffic was flowing over, the new 3-mile-long Pensacola Bay Bridge. Project leaders believed the worst could be avoided as the storm track called for it to land 200 miles away.Fifty-five construction barges were tied down but most were left in the jobsite area.Unexpectedly, the storm veered to the northeast and intensified—eventually becoming Hurricane Sally—coming ashore near Gulf Shores, Ala., only 30 miles west of the project site. Punished by wind and surge, 27 barges broke free of moorings, with several washing ashore on private property.The wind, waves and storm surge drove one 120-ft-long barge into the new bridge, taking a bite out of its deck section and damaging many beams. Because the old bridge was already being demolished, it could not be re-opened to traffic, cutting off many local residents from quick access to the other side of the bay. After months of extensive repairs—and millions of dollars in added costs—the bridge reopened in June.The overall cost to Skanska is still being tallied and includes penalties due to the Florida Dept. of Transportation for the bridge closure. But a four-day civil court trial of about 1,000 claims against the contractor by motorists and business and property owners concluded Oct. 22 in federal court in Pensacola. The decision could add millions to Skanska's total liability.The court record shows that during pretrial maneuvering in the days leading up to the trial, the main issue—whether Skanska’s team was prudent in leaving the barges in place, or negligent, and how members came to their decision—was being examined in minute detail.The case was initiated in 2020 by Skanska, seeking protection against likely claims for damage. It is known formally as  Skanska USA Civil Southeast Inc. and Skanska USA Inc., as ""Owners of the Barge M8030 Praying for Exoneration From or For Limitation of Liability.""Federal scientists have described Hurricane Sally's path and intensity as erratic. Skanska, the company claimed, took all reasonable steps to prepare for the storm, which suddenly changed direction and hit with unexpected intensity.Barge damage to section of Pensacola Bay Bridge. Photo: Courtesy of FDOTIn the spring, judges granted Skanska’s motion to limit the contractor’s liability—based on federal maritime law—to the value of the barges, which range from $125,000 to $550,000. One court document indicates that the ruling effectively limits Skanska’s liability total to about $7 million.After recruiting clients with television commercials, plaintiffs' attorneys later filed hundreds of lawsuits against Skanska on behalf of motorists and business owners. Among them are Yoshiko McKnight, the owner of Flowers by Yoko in Gulf Breeze, who seeks $62,000 in income she claims she lost as a result of Skanska barges damaging the bridge. Robello Lopaka, owner of another Gulf Breeze business, Aloha Screen Printing, seeks $56,000.Other claimants are seeking smaller amounts, based on added gas costs and auto use, from having to drive farther to reach destinations around the bay while the functional part of the new bridge was shut for repairs.An unusual decision by one judge came in August.Magistrate Judge Hope Thai Cannon imposed a penalty on Skanska of $92,000 for wiping clean or damaging five mobile phones used by key staff members on the project—an act that effectively destroyed trial evidence, she said. According to the judge, Skanska blamed gaps in its procedures for protecting lawsuit-related phone data.“This is a textbook case of spoliation,” meaning, the destruction of evidence, Cannon wrote in August in granting claimants' motion for a penalty.During pre-trial depositions earlier this year, lawyers for local residents and business owner claimants tried to pick apart the detailed procedures observed by Skanska’s staff in the days and hours before the hurricane struck. Claimants allege that Skanska had ample meteorological information about the hurricane’s path to relocate the construction barges away from the jobsite. The contractor's emergency plans, according to the claimants, say that task would have needed to start 30 hours before a storm hit.Instead, Skanska decided to keep working on the new bridge until the latest possible day and tied down the barges at the construction site so that work could continue, instead of moving them farther away, claimants allege.The path of Hurricane Sally took a turn to the northeast. Image: Courtesy of NOAAPre-trial maneuverings didn’t end until days before the trial started.Skanska filed a motion to exclude all testimony and evidence about other hurricanes and storms prior to and following Hurricane Sally. The court record isn’t clear about how, or if, that was decided by the judges.Another motion by Skanska sought to exclude deposition testimony of project manager Robert Rodgers, the third-highest employee on the project, because he was not, in the conractor's view, a “managing agent” of the project.The subject had come up earlier in the year when Skanska Project Executive Thomas DeMarco was deposed on June 18. The deposition was supposed to be about who had specific roles and responsibilities on the bridge replacement project. He was questioned by claimant attorney Thomas Gonzalez about that and about the hurricane plan itself.DeMarco testified in the deposition that the hurricane preparedness plan was part of the Skanska Environmental Health & Safety responsibilities, and that it includes inclement weather. Gonzalez had DeMarco show him exactly who on Skanska’s staff had responsibility for the EHS plan. The group included the project superintendent and a safety manager, field engineer and project engineer. All had signed off on the safety plan created as work on the project moved in 2016 to 2017 from a precast yard located on land to working over water.The Pensacola Bay Bridge connects Pensacola with Gulf Breeze. Map: Courtesy of Wikimedia CommonsUnder questioning, DeMarco testified that he and Rodgers had responsibility for keeping an eye out for weather and long-range weather forecasts and that meteorological data was supplied by a consultant, Alan Archer & Associates.During the interrogation, attorney Gonzalez sometimes veered outside the agreed subject of the deposition—delineating responsibilities and roles on the project.“In the process of implementing a hurricane preparedness plan, was there someone who had the role of monitoring the expenditures or budget associated with implementation?” he asked.Skanska’s lawyer objected and the question wasn’t answered at that time.Both sides in the case are now preparing post-trial motions and it is unlikely that there will be a ruling from the court before December.",1,0,0,0
2021-09-29,Massachusetts Building Trade Unions Launch Addiction Services Initiative,https://www.enr.com/articles/52536-massachusetts-building-trade-unions-launch-addiction-services-initiative,29-Sep-21,"When Marty Walsh hit bottom in his struggle with alcohol in 1995, his fellow building trade union members helped him stay sober.

Now U.S. Labor Secretary, a former Boston mayor, and laborers' union and building trades official who’s been sober for more than 20 years, Walsh joined the Massachusetts Building Trades Council on Sept. 29 to announce a new initiative to ensure that workers get the same support he did.

“These initiatives will help countless workers get access to recovery services, reduce the stigma that prevents people from getting help and advance our fight to end the epidemic of addiction that impacts every part of our country,” Walsh says.

The council has formed the Massachusetts Building Trades Recovery Council and created a new online resource to help union members, or their dependents, who are struggling with alcohol or drug addiction. It includes a weekly schedule of recovery meetings, 24/7 phone numbers for members who need help, and assist with services like treatment and counseling.

Some individual trade unions already had peer support programs in place for members. The new program unifies them into one program and is accompanied by an awareness campaign to inform members of available services.

Jillian Higgins, a fourth-year apprentice at International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103, says her union’s weekly recovery meetings have been a big help to her and others. Her recovery leader works hard getting people into detox and back on the job. “Unions are about strength in numbers, and so is recovery,” she says.

From 2015-2017, the opioid fatality rate for construction workers was seven times the average for all workers in Massachusetts, according to a 2019 study published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine. Construction workers accounted for more than 24% of opioid-related deaths among the state’s working population.

That trend isn’t exclusive to Massachusetts. As ENR previously reported, other studies have shown that construction is one of the occupations most prone to overdose deaths. Issues including addiction, mental health and suicide among workers have increasingly been seeing attention from the industry, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, ENR reported in July.

The issue has also seen attention from union workers in Boston. In 2019, ENR reported on two work site standdowns in Boston during National Recovery Week to recognize workers who died from opioid overdoses.

For those who have gone through recovery or worked with those who have, this issue isn’t new.

The North Atlantic States Regional Carpenters’ Carpenter’s Assistance Program recently celebrated 30 years of helping union carpenters, says Paul Greeley, executive director. It provides an extended care program to allow members and their dependents to get 24-hour residential treatment and helps them transition back to the workforce. He says he hopes the new initiative will help remove “the stigma of addiction.”

Frank Callahan, president of the Massachusetts Building Trades Council, says the groups and their leadership have helped create a “culture of recovery among the trades.”

Other union addiction recovery and support programs wrapped into the initiative include the Teamsters Local 25 Referral and Follow-up Team and Laborers Local 429’s Laborers Escaping Addiction Now.

“In the building trades there’s no shame and no stigma, there’s only solidarity,” Callahan says.

2021-09-01,"Q&A: Bentley Systems' Claire Rutkowski on Remote Work, Burnout and the Hybrid Office",https://www.enr.com/articles/52346-qa-bentley-systems-claire-rutkowski-on-remote-work-burnout-and-the-hybrid-office,1-Sep-21,"Rutkowski

As chief information officer and senior vice president at software vendor Bentley Systems, Claire Rutkowski spends a great deal of time talking to Chief Technology Officers and other tech-minded people in AEC firms. Earlier this summer she hosted a panel at the Environmental Financial Consulting Group's Technology Leadership conference on what technology for remote work means in the future, as some firms transition to bring some workers back to the office. Rutkowski took the time to chat with ENR Senior Technology Editor Jeff Rubenstone about how technology is enabling long-term remote working, and what managers must learn to run a hybrid office. The transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.

ENR: Here we are, more than a year into the disruption from COVID-19, and many companies still have employees working from home or are beginning to bring them back to the office. What has been your experience with this, both at Bentley Systems and among the industry firms you’re talking to regularly?

Rutkowski: This is a different world now. We're coming out of the pandemic into a world where employees have very high expectations and are being very clear about the fact that they don't want to go into the office every day. They want to have a hybrid model.

A lot of people are coming out of this [phase of] the pandemic and reassessing their life priorities and what they're doing. There's a lot of competition for qualified talent and a lot of that qualified talent is asking, do you have remote or hybrid options?

I think that the majority of companies are thinking they're going to have to go hybrid in order to attract the right talent, but the other thing important to note is that—while we don't know what's going to happen with the Delta variant—in the meantime life has continued. Businesses have continued, deliverables have been met, and despite the kind of old school thinking of “I have to see you to know you're working,” I think people have realized throughout the pandemic that, in many cases, productivity has gone up, not down.

ENR: Being present in the office was a key part of many office cultures before the pandemic, with managers walking cubicle rows to confirm everyone is getting work done.

Pre-pandemic, most people were in the office. The managers did go up and down the rows, looking over people's shoulders, sitting in on design reviews and seeing literally see how things were going. During the pandemic everybody was remote, so managers have pretty much I think figured out the skill of managing remote colleagues. Or, if they haven't figured it out, the evidence of that is now becoming very visible.

But I think they're actually in for a harder time than that, because pre-pandemic was a level playing field, with most people in the office. Most people out of the office, working from home, is also [a level playing field]. Now we're going to get into a time where 70% of people want to be in or out, a hybrid [arrangement]. And some are going to be all the way at home and some are going to be all the way in the office for most companies. And it's not a level playing field anymore.

So the manager is going to have to learn those skills. “So now I have to manage remote? I have to manage in person and I have to make it feel fair and the same for everyone.” That's a whole different set of challenges. That's a whole new ball game that I think is going to require training. It's going to require a real concentration on different things that people haven't had to deal with.

They're going to have to be the ones that make sure that there isn't an A Team in the office and the B Team that is remote. They're going to have to make sure that when they have meetings, they don't just have all the “in the office” people that day—they're going to have to be careful how they keep the team together because it won't be together, but it won't be everyone apart and [working] remotely either. It will be in between.

ENR: Do you think there’s some anxiety among remote workers about not responding fast enough to requests, that persistent suspicion that managers think everyone who comes into the office is by default more on the ball?

Exactly, and I think that's something that managers are really going to have to watch for. They're going to have to mediate relationships between the people on their teams to make sure they are alert for resentment or jealousy, or that somebody who has chosen to be remote is kind of gradually shutting down, feeling less included and becoming disengaged. Because if the people who do not come in the office start feeling disengaged from the people who do then then you're going to see a loss of productivity and you don't want that right? I mean, purely from a work perspective. Lack of engagement is a lack of productivity is a loss of profit margin and revenue. 

So I think managers are going to have to continue that understanding and empathy, and so are the leaders of the companies that used to have everyone in the office and decided to go hybrid. They can't choose to go hybrid to attract talent but then resent it everyday. Because that's not really fair either.

ENR: There’s also the issue of overworking and the reluctance to take time off that was already there before the pandemic in this industry. You have some work cultures where no one wants to be seen as absent or not totally engaged at all times, which gets extra stressful in extended work-from-home scenarios.

Last year and this year, I have talked about and emailed and written about mental health to the people on my team more than I ever have before. Whether it was at the beginning of the pandemic or later on, I could tell that people were online at like crazy hours and they sounded kind of tired. And I know there's the stress of the pandemic and everything around it to take into account as well.

And that may have been some of it, but I think it was also was they were really afraid that they were going to be let go. And so I found myself in the kind of unusual position of having a mandatory ""all hands"" in which I told everybody to stop working so hard.

I've never done that before, but I knew they were working unhealthy hours and I had to explicitly say “look, no one is looking over your virtual shoulder.” I get it, there's stuff happening, so let’s find a way to buffer between work and home, and I gave them some suggestions and then it was an email all about self care. It's OK to not be OK. It's OK to cancel your meetings for the day. if you're just feeling anxious and stressed, you don't have to turn on the dang camera, you know? Because I know some people find that mentally exhausting.

ENR: Do you see similar signs of anxiety across the broader industry in your conversations with CTOs and others at firms?

I think people in general are getting burned out. Not only do they have the pressure of trying to keep up the momentum and keep up with deadlines, but they’re doing it remotely and having to do virtual design reviews. Maybe they’re using virtual reality if they're lucky enough, but otherwise everything is just a little bit harder to do. It's that overall uncertainty of just not knowing what's going to happen next [with COVID-19]. It's exhausting.

ENR: Do you get the sense that, over a year into this, companies and management are beginning to adapt to the new state of affairs?

On the bright side, I do think companies have realized through the pandemic that their colleagues can be trusted to be productive remotely, so they're more open to that now. They've had to leverage a lot of digital collaboration tools and get used to asynchronous communication.

I think companies are much better equipped to handle it and have the right tools at least to handle it. And so the emphasis, as it did for me, moves from tools and skills and equipping people to care about and support people, mental health, engagement, and inclusivity, particularly from middle managers, to level that playing field. I would like to think that makes the AEC industry a more inclusive and better place to work overall.

ENR: Construction is often seen as being behind the curve on new technology and management styles. Do you think the industry is going to adapt to these new ways of working?

For the most part people are going to embrace the opportunity here. I don't think of this as just a choice between mandating return to the office or enabling a hybrid working model or allowing people to work fully remote. It's a leadership challenge. But it's also a leadership opportunity, an opportunity for the chief executive

CEOs will say “I’ve seen you all work productively for the last year and a half. I trust you to make the right choices for you and for your families about where you want to spend your time and how you want to work. But I also trust that you'll focus and work productively at work—whether you're at work at your desk, or whether you're at work at home.”

I think that CEOs who do this will find attracting and retaining talent easier, that the engagement and morale of their employees will improve and they will provide a much more inclusive workplace. I think they'll feel much more supported and welcomed to stay as long as they can work out the right kind of schedule with their manager.

For me it's a “lean in” moment. Are you going to do it or are you going to slip backwards?

“Nimble” is frequently used to describe how AEC human resources leaders responded to the cascade of challenges in the past year. On top of supporting field crews to help keep jobsites safe and productive amid Covid-19 outbreaks, HR teams scrambled to craft strategies for maintaining connections across a suddenly dispersed office workforce, sustain recruiting efforts with only limited access to prospective candidates and conduct sometimes difficult discussions of social justice issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement.Though existing crisis plans gave some firms a head start on shaping responses to some of those challenges, guidance for others was virtually non-existent.
“There was no playbook for a global pandemic,” recalls Nicole Calamaio, chief HR officer for Tempe, Ariz.-based Sundt Construction Co. “We were making decisions quickly in areas where we didn’t have a lot of expertise.”More than 18 months later, HR teams can be cautiously proud of having shepherded their companies from one iteration of the new normal to the next. But now they find themselves faced with an equally knotty task—maintaining a high level of agility, not only to sustain those efforts, but also to keep their organizations in step with whatever dynamics the future holds.For example, HR professionals agree that the past year has substantially changed employee expectations, particularly in the area of work locations. While some people have welcomed the opportunity to return to 9-to-5 routines with the lifting of pandemic restrictions, others have sought to preserve the more flexible schedules and safety advantages of working remotely. They also welcomed their employers’ stepped-up communication efforts to keep dispersed workers connected as the pandemic unfolded.“Employees expect more flexibility and more transparency,” says Julie Kellman, vice president of HR for Pepper Construction Group, Chicago. “We’ve raised the bar on ourselves to share more information, and we will have to continue doing it.”Maintaining a virtual workforce for the long term may be easier said than done, however. As companies look for ways to implement hybrid models that combine home and office work hours, striking an optimal balance may well prove to be a bigger challenge than sending everyone home at the outset of the pandemic. Accommodating requests for greater flexibility is one thing, explains Rob Barclay, chief HR officer for Richmond, Va., A/E firm Draper Aden. “But you also want to maintain your culture and have the right level of collaboration, communication and social interaction in the office,” he adds. “That’s particularly important for employees new to the industry, who are still building their professional skill sets.”Nor are all managers fully equipped to manage a virtual workforce. Setting expectations, goals and monitoring performance “is going to be an ongoing effort,” Barclay adds.ATCS, a Herndon, Va.-based consulting engineering firm, is among the organizations that have significantly revamped their approach to remote work. What had been a formal process for considering such requests has largely been replaced with more streamlined employee-manager discussions on performance expectations and accessibility.“We’re a completely different organization now,” says ATCS human resources vice president Sherri Huntley.Though some firms want to be flexible, they may be limited by contractual and operational relationships with clients and partners as to what can be done. “Our clients have certain expectations of our project teams,” explains Lauren Nunnally, vice president and chief talent officer for Swinerton, the San Francisco-based contractor and construction manager. “Altering team presence on site could present challenges that we need to be sensitive to.”Still, industry HR consultant Juli Smith warns that insisting on a full return to pre-pandemic office routines could ultimately prove detrimental.
“Staying too rigid will affect retention and the ability to attract people,” Smith warns, citing anecdotal evidence of rejected job offers because of strict limits on working from home.Original image courtesy of Getty ImagesStress SignalsThe pandemic’s usurpation of office and jobsite routines also put the spotlight on employee mental and emotional wellness, an issue that industry HR professionals agree has not always received the attention it deserved but can no longer be ignored.“The pandemic really opened up a discussion that had been taboo, and swept under the rug,” Calamaio says. “It’s much easier to talk about it now.”
Nunnally agrees, saying that in addition to looking at further mental health resources and benefits for both office and jobsite employees, “it’s important to train all of our managers and leaders on how to effectively lead in this space—how to check-in with employees, what to pay attention to and how to offer and show support.”Also difficult, but just as important, were the deeper conversations on diversity and inclusion sparked last summer as Black Lives Matter marches took place across the country. Many HR leaders report having refined their existing minority recruitment and mentoring plans to make measures more intentional, from designating executives to championing diversity, to conducting focus groups to discuss where existing efforts have both succeeded and fallen short.“The events of last summer were an amazing jolt to all of us,” says Kellman. She adds that Pepper Construction quickly formalized its long-standing approach to diversity into a five-pillar framework that the company can use “to lean into all diversity and inclusion efforts—employees, trades, subcontractors and customers.” Such discussions and actions will also be necessary to meet the changing expectations of prospective employees as the competition for skilled talent continues to intensify.  “People expect an organization to be focused on inclusion and diversity,” Huntley says. “They’re asking questions about what we’re doing, so we need to be sure our hiring managers can answer them.”At the same time, a firm’s commitment to diversity also demands a commitment to respect all viewpoints. Nunnally recalls being somewhat surprised to see some polarization within Swinerton’s employee base regarding subjects perceived as political on some level. “This really forced us to think very carefully about what rules, policies and programs we wanted to put in place and, more importantly, how we wanted to message them,” she says. “Trying to figure out how to communicate in a way that resonated with all employees while creating safe and inclusive work environments was challenging.”

Listening and Learning
Listening to employees’ changing needs and concerns may well be the key to the successful evolution of AEC human resources. Many firms already are making more frequent use of surveys and other information-gathering techniques to gauge the sentiment of staff members. Some post-pandemic challenges already are taking shape, from gradually loosening state and local laws on marijuana possession and use to accommodating leave requests for religious observances that up to now have not appeared on traditional company holiday calendars.“Employee engagement is a must, and that includes listening and responding to what they say,” Smith says. Given the demand for talent and people’s newfound ability to work seamlessly from almost anywhere, she says, “they can more easily look elsewhere than before.” While such communication will be critical, “we have to remember that we’ll still have a multigenerational workforce, with different ways of accessing information,” cautions Sally Tate, vice president of people strategies for Richmond, Va. -based Hourigan, a contractor. “The future will be one of constant adaptation.”Despite the uncertainties that may lie ahead, Sundt’s Calamaio says a willingness to do whatever is necessary to treat employees well and respond to their needs will provide HR departments with the necessary nimbleness to continue their ongoing evolution. “Things are moving faster than ever,” she says, “but it ultimately still comes down to caring.”  ",1,0,0,0
2021-07-29,Achieving Healthful Mental Mise en Place Through Design,https://www.enr.com/articles/52168-achieving-healthful-mental-mise-en-place-through-design,29-Jul-21,"In French, “mise en place” is a culinary term referring to having ingredients prepped and cooking tools accessible that can take chefs to a place of cognitive calm before preparing a meal. Similarly, when a building is intentionally designed, elements of a building can have a positive effect on the mental health and well-being of the occupants, according to research  conducted by the International WELL Building Institute. The research is especially relevant as employers give new emphasis to employee mental health and well-being in stressful times amid a hoped-for return to normal indoor work and recreation (see p. 16).

The collective effect of a building’s performance on occupants is referred to as indoor environmental quality (IEQ). WELL scores a building’s IEQ health according to its WELL Building Standard by measuring a total of 10 benchmarks—including air, water, nourishment, light, movement, total comfort, material, community and mind.

The standard uses the term building health “but we define it as all parameters in a building performance,” says Gayathri Unnikrishnan, who serves as the New York City-based institute’s concept lead for light. “So not just the air quality,” she explains, which is wrongly seen as the sole cause of “sick building syndrome.” 

“We consider a healthy building to be an agent of change for public health. And we know, through decades of research, that thoughtful and intentional strategies in design and operations make a healthy building,” says Unnikrishnan, “and healthy buildings help people strive.” 

Most importantly, healthy buildings are people-centered spaces. “This means that the health and well-being of the people inside the building stays at the center of decision-making at all points,” says Unnikrishnan.

Connecting people and nature within a built environment via biophilic design can ease stress and reduce anxiety, according to WELL.

But a building’s operations are just as important as design in keeping spaces healthy, says Unnikrishnan.

Air quality is one example. “Good air purification features in a building can treat air to meet standards that have been set. But if these features don’t undergo regular maintenance, the building can actually impair people’s health,” she explains. “Operational policies are absolutely essential and are required to support mental and physical health.” 

The healthiest buildings are intentional from the earliest stages of design, says Ihab Elzeyadi, professor of architecture and the director of the High Performance Environments lab (HiPE) at the University of Oregon’s architecture department. 

“There are many things that go into the design that need to be incorporated early on,” he says. “For example natural ventilation. The idea, if you are going to have operable windows or shafts, have major implications to the form of the building.""

At Elzeyadi’s HiPE lab, proposed new standards to increase IEQ performance are tested and then results are published for broader review— and to  influence client owners to adopt and implement improved and updated standards in their future building projects.

The standard development journey at HiPE lab is far from finished.

“We are testing these standards constantly, and we are also coming up with other things that the standards might have overlooked,” says Elzeyadi. While the standards so far have been mostly about comfort and some physiological impacts like heart rate and sick leave and similar concerns, cognitive performance and stress hasn’t been incorporated.

But cognitive performance, stress reduction and everything related to stress recovery are, in Elzeyadi’s view, just as important to well-being in buildings. A better approach is to think about these issues at the beginning of the standard-writing process, including “what the current research findings are, what are the guidelines and what are the trends and evidence that need to be incorporated.”

And that, he concludes, “I think is the major gap,” between applying research to standard writing in construction. ",1,0,0,0
2021-07-13,LA Plant Spills 17 Million Gallons of Untreated Sewage Into Pacific,https://www.enr.com/articles/52085-la-plant-spills-17-million-gallons-of-untreated-sewage-into-pacific,13-Jul-21,"The City of Los Angeles’ Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant in Playa del Rey, Calif., spilled 17 million gallons of raw sewage, 6% of its daily load, into the Santa Monica Bay starting July 11 due to a clog of debris–but a timeline shows that health officials failed to inform the public and close contaminated beaches  for nearly 18 hours after the incident began.

""We are just getting into the investigation, but we do know that the massive amounts of debris were landscaping and construction materials, as well as grease balls,"" says Elena Stern, senior public information director at the City of Los Angeles Dept. of Public Works. 

The Hyperion plant is operated by Los Angeles Dept. of Sanitation and is Los Angeles County’s largest water treatment facility.

The spill forced closure of at least four miles of county beaches, including those in Dockweiller State Park and in El Segundo, Calif., after the spill started at 7 p.m., and continued through 5 a.m., on July 12, according to Heal the Bay, an environmental nonprofit that advocates for safe and clean coastal waters and watersheds in Greater Los Angeles.

The plant was inundated with overwhelming quantities of debris, causing backup of the headworks facilities, according to Timeyin Dafeta, Hyperion executive plant manager in a statement released July 12.

""The plant's relief system was triggered, and sewage flows were controlled through use of the plant's one-mile outfall and discharge of untreated sewage into Santa Monica Bay,” Dafeta said in the statement.

Treated sewage is normally discharged through a five-mile outfall.

“During the eight hours of discharge through the one-mile outfall, approximately 17 million gallons of sewage (representing 6 % of a daily load) were discharged as an emergency measure to prevent the plant from going completely offline and discharging much more raw sewage,” according to the statement.

The department said protocols for notifying regulatory agencies and California office of emergency services were followed. LA County Dept. of Health says, ultimately, it is elected officials’ responsibility to notify the public of the danger. “Public Health is responsible for determining the need for and making the initial notification to the public, often with support from other entities,” said the public health department in an email to ENR. “This typically occurs within two hours of the determination that an incident has occurred which requires a beach closure.”

A July 12, 2:25 p.m., tweet by Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn was the first public disclosure of the incident.

The Tweet says, in part, “A power outage at the Hyperion plant last night caused untreated sewage to be discharged into the ocean.” The sanitation department would not clarify if a power outage contributed to the incident.

“We need answers from LA City Sanitation about what went wrong and led to this massive spill, but we also need to recognize that LA County Public Health did not effectively communicate with the public and could have put swimmers in danger,” says Hahn.

Beaches in the Los Angeles area are owned and operated by Los Angeles County and maintained by the county’s Dept. of Beaches and Harbors. Its crews first noticed drainage coming from a small pipe in the median of the Imperial Highway entrance to Dockweiler State Beach parking lot on July 11 (the drainage did not flow into the sand), says Beaches and Harbors Public Information Officer Nicole Mooradian.

Beaches and Harbors contacted contractor Ocean Blue, a hazardous waste management service company, which arrived at 9 p.m. and used three large vacuum vehicles to pump 100% of the drainage into a city approved line. That evening, Beaches and Harbors learned the drainage stemmed from a larger issue at the Hyperion Plant.

“To my knowledge, we were not informed of the size of the spill until the next day,” says Mooradian. “This drainage was our first indication that Hyperion was having issues with its pumps.”

Drew Boyles, mayor of the City of El Segundo, where the beach is closed due to contamination, says he first learned of the incident and beach closures from Hahn and wants to know the exact cause of the outflow.

“How will this be avoided in the future?” asks Boyles. “What reassurances will you provide LA County visitors and residents that your process and outflow is safe and sanitary?”

Hyperion says water quality sampling and testing of shoreline samples are being conducted, and boats are being sent to outfalls to observe and sample for analyses following regulatory permit protocols. Dafeta noted that all flow is again being treated through standard treatment processes. “We are investigating the cause of the debris and repairing damaged equipment,” he said.

Timeline
On Sunday, July 11, at 7:59 p.m., Hyperion staff sent a spill report to the California State Warning Center, according to Ellie Mirmazaheri, public information officer for the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services
On Sunday, July 11, at 8:11 p.m., Cal OES notified via email the Los Angeles County’s public health department that a sewage incident occurred at Hyperion. At that time, Cal OES also notified: Los Angeles County Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), Long Beach Environmental Health, LA County Sheriff Dept., LA County Environmental Health, LA County Fire Dept., LA County Dept. of Public Works, California Dept. of Toxic Substance Control, Regional Water Quality Control Board, US EPA, US Fish & Wildlife Service, California Dept. of Fish & Wildlife, California Coastal Commission, California State Lands Commission, California Department of Parks & Recreations, US Coast Guard.
At approximately 9 p.m. on Sunday, Beaches and Harbors contractor Ocean Blue, a hazardous waste management service company, which arrived at Dockweiller State Park after crews noticed drainage coming from a small pipe. The contractor used three large vacuum vehicles to pump 100% of the drainage into a city approved line. That evening, Beaches and Harbors learned the drainage stemmed from a larger issue at the Hyperion Plant.
At 10:36 p.m. on Sunday, public health inspectors arrived onsite to determine the extent of the sewage discharge. 
At 12:58 a.m. on Monday, Hyperion officials were still unable to determine how much sewage was discharged through the one-mile outlet. 
At 10 a.m. Monday, Hyperion officials confirmed to the health department that the plant discharged 17 million gallons of untreated sewage through their one and five-mile outlets, prompting the beach closures. 
At 11 a.m. Monday, the health department began posting signs at closed beaches, “since there was an inspector already collecting water samples as part of the routine water sampling process and initiated the website posting identifying the closing of the four of the beaches in the vicinity of the outlets until the ocean water testing meets State standards for acceptable water quality.”
At 2:25 p.m. on Monday, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn sent a Tweet that was the first public disclosure of the incident.
At 5:15 p.m. Monday, the health department issued a press release.

The health department cites its 2014 standard operating procedures and sewage spill flow that public notification includes, posting closure signs at the affected beaches, updating the websites, notifying lifeguards, and providing information on the Environmental Health telephone hotline.

“We are evaluating our response to this incident and will update our practices going forward to ensure that measures are in place to effectively notify the public,” the health department tells ENR.

2021-04-22,Georgia Tech's Kendeda Is a Model for 'Living Buildings' in the Humid Southeast,https://www.enr.com/articles/51639-georgia-techs-kendeda-is-a-model-for-living-buildings-in-the-humid-southeast,22-Apr-21,"Thanks to relaxed COVID-19 guidelines from the International Living Future Institute and a digital twin, the 47,000-sq-ft Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta lost no time becoming a role model for Living Buildings in hot, humid climates. ILFI’s rigorous Living Building Challenge program anointed the project as a Living Building on Earth Day, April 22.

The Kendeda Building, which won an ENR Best of the Best Projects award, is the first building of its scale to achieve full certification in the Southeast. The building’s photovoltaic solar array satisfies 100% of the energy needs, and overproduces another 125% under the business-as-usual model, according to the Kendeda team.

Though the Living Building is certified net-positive for water and energy use, it’s rainwater-to-potable water system—though permitted and tested—is not operational because state regulators have not given the green light to flip the switch on the system.

Water is Most Challenging

“Water not energy is the most challenging” aspect of creating a Living Building, says Shan Arora, Kendeda’s director. “I knew it was possible to get a building to a high level of [energy] efficiency,” adds Arora, who arrived at the project in July 2018, after construction had begun. “Getting a building to be its own municipal water district” is another matter, he adds.

The permit from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD), granted for the potable water system during the 12-month Living Building Challenge performance period, validates that the water system produces safe drinking water with continuous chlorination disinfection, he explains. But that is not sufficient.

“We are working with EPD to determine how this first-of-its-kind, public, nontransient, noncommunity water system in Georgia can meet the ongoing testing requirements of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Primary and Secondary Drinking Water Regulations and Georgia’s Rules for Safe Drinking Water,” says Arora.

This pertains to the number of treated water samples, sampling locations and the frequency of sampling during operation. Once the logistics of ongoing testing are in place and with EPD’s approval, Georgia Tech expects to activate the rainwater-to-drinking water system pursuant to the permit issued in 2020, Arora adds.

The pandemic and subsequent building shut-downs and reduced occupancy threatened to delay certification related to the Living Building Challenge’s required year-long operational period to validate performance objectives, based on occupancy. During the performance period, a project must prove it is net positive for energy and water, which means it generates more energy from onsite renewable sources than it uses and it collects and treats more rainwater onsite than it uses for all purposes, including for drinking.

COVID-19 Disruption Guidelines

In response to the pandemic, ILFI issued COVID-19 disruption guidelines for Living Building teams to justify net-positive energy and water use, without having to postpone the performance period. Under the guidelines, ILFI reviews each project on a case-by-case basis. Projects are evaluated based on energy models or other criteria.

Consequently, the Kendeda Building was reviewed and approved based on its detailed energy model, which is based on its digital twin. For more than two years during the project, researchers from Georgia Tech’s Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory had been embedded with the building’s design team, supporting data analysis and scenario modeling throughout construction and the building’s  commissioning. The lab had access to the building’s data platforms and had gained an understanding of the building hardware and operations.

Digital Twin

Using the data, the lab created and calibrated a Kendeda Building digital twin—defined as a set of models that mimics the structure, context and behavior of a unique physical asset. A digital twin can be updated with real data from its physical twin throughout its lifecycle and can therefore evaluate alternative scenarios that the physical building could encounter—for example a pandemic.

For Kendeda, the 12-month performance period was Dec. 1, 2019 to Nov. 30, 2020. During that time, the building operated on a normal schedule until the end of March 2020, when COVID-19 disrupted operations. Results of the digital twin calculation show that if the building had been occupied based on originally planned class schedules and event programming, it would have supplied and infiltrated back to the ground 15 times more water than it used, and supplied 225% of its energy needs during the performance period, says the Kendeda team.

To create a baseline, the model was calibrated to actual usage schedules, weather and other conditions that the building experienced. The baseline was then modified to show what the building would have used if 2020 had been a typical year.

The energy model was reviewed and vetted by consulting engineer PAE, which provided ILFI a letter endorsing the digital twin’s energy performance data.

“Our peer review looked at the overall process of modeling, the calibration and the results and provided validation that the method used was in line with industry standards and in our opinion, reliable,” says Marc Brune, a principal of PAE, which is no stranger to Living Buildings. PAE is co-developing, designing and leasing its own Living Building, the PAE Living Building, in Portland, Ore. The building is on course for completion in September.

The Kendeda Building’s actual energy use intensity (EUI) over the last year was about 14 kBTU per sq ft per year, or 185% net positive, says Brune. The model predicted that under normal operation, the EUI would have been about 18, or 125% net positive.

The digital twin also calculated results for a “stress test” based on an unrealistic 12 months of maximum occupancy, which was defined as 500 people continuously in the building every Monday through Friday from 7am to 10pm, says the Kendeda team.

The model predicted that under an extreme high-use scenario, the EUI would have been about 32 or 25% net positive, says Brune.       

“The high-use scenario matched most closely with our energy modeling assumptions, which predicted ~30 kBTU per sq ft per year,” he adds.

Seven Performance Categories

The Kendeda Building has met all the conditions for full certification under the Living Building Challenge’s seven performance categories, called petals—place, water, energy, health plus happiness, materials, equity and beauty.  

The team says the energy petal is challenging in a warm humid climate. To meet the challenge, the Kendeda design team segregated ventilation and cooling, which is accomplished through radiant floor heating and cooling that circulates water through piping. For ventilation and dehumidification, there is a dedicated outdoor air system.

“We decoupled ventilation from temperature,” says Joshua R. Gassman, sustainable design director, Lord Aeck Sargent, a Katerra Co., which served as a project lead designer along with Miller Hull Partnership. “Most buildings expend energy to dehumidify not cool,” he adds.

For this, the building envelope is “extremely” airtight to keep humidity out, with weather barriers, air curtains and vestibules at main entrances, says Gassman.

Arora adds, “it is a very big deal that a building can make it to net-positive energy in the hot humid South.”

Back-to-the-Future Design Approach

The Kendeda team also took a back-to-the-future passive-system approach in the siting and layout of the building and its systems. These include natural ventilation, ceiling fans and shading, combined with off-the-shelf technology, such as active blinds. Windows are operable, and some façade openings are as large as 10 ft square.

By opening and closing windows and more, in moderate temperature months, “we can keep occupants more comfortable” without flipping the switch on mechanical heating or cooling, says Gassman.

For certification success, almost every building component or system has more than one simultaneous function. “The only [element] that can only do one thing at a time is the fire extinguisher,” says Gassman.

For example, though the primary function of the rooftop solar panels is to generate energy, the photovoltaic array also serves as a canopy that shades the façade. The canopy also collects rainwater for the potable water system and it defines the porch space on the western façade, Gassman explains.  

There are other Kendeda Building bells and whistles of sustainability. Rainwater water is stored in a 50,000-gallon cistern in the basement, before being treated and used for all purposes, eventually including drinking. For gray water, there is natural treatment outdoors in the form of bioswales.

The building is composed of materials screened for ILFI’s hazardous “Red List” chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA), halogenated flame retardants, phthalates and formaldehyde. Chemicals on the Red List have been shown to harm human and environmental health, even though they are common in most buildings, says ILFI.

Wood from sustainably managed forests, salvaged materials and other sourcing strategies significantly reduce the building’s embodied carbon footprint.

By eliminating 99% of its construction waste and incorporating reclaimed locally sourced materials, such as reclaimed wood for the structural decking and salvaged slate tile in the restrooms, the project diverted more waste from the landfill than it sent to the landfill, says Georgia Tech.

Composting toilets nearly eliminate potable water use for sewage conveyance and allow for human waste to be turned into fertilizer for use off site. The building allows for universal access via an accessible ramp connecting the terraced main floor.

Beyond the Equity Petal

The design and construction team went beyond the equity petal by promoting an equitable and inclusive sense of community, says Georgia Tech. For example, general contractor Skanska USA Building Inc. partnered with Georgia Works!, a nonprofit helping chronically homeless men become self-sufficient, to build the ceiling panels and floor systems.

The Kendeda team’s message to others considering a sustainable building in the Southeast or anywhere: Don’t be intimidated by the Kendeda’s full certification.

“As aspirational as we want everyone to be, we also need to be sure that the perfect is not the enemy of the good,” says Gassman. “We don’t need every building to be a Living Building, though it would be nice if it were. But we do need every building to perform a lot better than the status quo.”

Gassman’s advice: “Set ambitious goals and even if you don’t achieve them, you will end up with a building that performs better than if you set less ambitious goals.”

Arora invites all those interested to tour the building. He likens the sustainable systems to a restaurant menu. “For our building, we ordered everything on the menu,” he says. “But simply ordering a few items is better than nothing. If people come in thinking about LEED Gold, we hope they will leave thinking about LEED Platinum.”",1,0,0,0
2021-04-21,Engineer Ardurra's Calm Through the COVID-19 Storm,https://www.enr.com/articles/51632-engineer-ardurras-calm-through-the-covid-19-storm,21-Apr-21,"Project disruption due to COVID-19 is a universal concern for design firms. Yet often overlooked is the pandemic’s impact on employees.A company-wide survey at Ardurra (No. 190) revealed nearly 40% of the firm’s 500-plus staff battled anxious feelings about work and loneliness during the pandemic’s early stages. The firm also saw an uptick in the use of staff mental health services. Putting heads together on a plan to help employees, leadership introduced a free subscription to the Calm meditation app to encourage teams to put mental health first. More than 300 employees responded.“It’s not just about engineering and work, it’s about feeling good where you are at,” explains CEO Ernesto Aguilar about the firm’s investments in employee mental health. “I think a lot of people saw it as a way the company is thinking about them during these weird times.”

The Calm app guides users through meditation, reads soothing stories for sleep and includes instructional podcasts that focus on handling stress and resetting the mind. “It takes a while but it does work,” says Aguilar, who meditates every day. Since introducing the app, the firm reported a major increase in employee productivity, and already has plans to make the app available for another year. The firm also plans to make work from home a permanent option for all employees.“One of the things that we are most proud of is that our turnover rate is extremely low,” says Aguilar. He believes small gestures have a big impact. “We send a signal to the employees that we care about their personal lives.”Beyond mental health, Ardurra is also working to establish a greater connection among the firm’s more than 30 offices. Early last spring, the company celebrated its inaugural “Ardurra Day” with a virtual happy hour, and unveiled a top-down outreach program to foster “meaningful conversations” among staff.Despite the pandemic, Ardurra acquired two Florida-based engineering firms specializing in water, wastewater and public works markets—Constantine Engineering Inc., and Pigeon-Roberts & Associates LLC.“Last year was an incredible year for us,” says Aguilar. “Our backlog has grown tremendously. Profitability is probably the best year we had. So, it’s worked.”",1,0,0,0

2021-03-01,Wisconsin Governor Seeks $2.4B in Wisconsin Capital Budget,https://www.enr.com/articles/51316-wisconsin-governor-seeks-24b-in-wisconsin-capital-budget,1-Mar-21,"Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) is looking to invest about $2.38 billion in the state’s infrastructure for 2021-23, as proposed in his capital budget plan unveiled Feb. 22. Prominent with Evers' proposal were a $163-million state office building project in Milwaukee, and a $150-million engineering research building at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, among others. 

Lawmakers also will be considering a $91-billion state budget, which Evers proposed on Feb. 16, which Republicans are already opposing due to the  proposal to generate sales tax revenues by legalizing marijuana.

Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R) has called legalizing cannabis a “poisoned pill” to include in the budget and predicts that it has no chance of passing, according to news reports.

In the last budget submitted by Evers, in June 2019, Republicans on the budget committee voted to spend $1.9 billion on building projects, which was $600 million less than the $2.5 billion Evers had sought.

Evers’ proposed capital budget would take advantage of historically low bond rates, according to a statement released by Evers’ office, and would invest in projects to ensure their longevity and public safety.

“It's about our priorities—from investing in sustainable energy options and protecting our public lands, to supporting the growth of our UW campuses and students, to reforming our juvenile justice system, to investing in community development, this capital budget will have a far-reaching impact on our communities and our state for generations to come,” Evers said in a statement.

In addition to higher education, the 268-page proposed budget covers such areas as correctional and health services facilities, veteran care, natural resources management and energy conservation.

A prominent proposed project is a new $163-million state office building to be constructed in Milwaukee. The project would consolidate state agency functions under one roof and include a parking structure.  

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett (D) championed the project, noting in a statement that it ""will positively affect not only the immediate neighborhood but also the surrounding areas.""

The budget also tags $4 million to begin preliminary designs for redeveloping a block in downtown Madison near the Capitol. The site, currently occupied by the Dept. of Workforce Development, would be redeveloped for a new office building and a museum.

Evers’ recommendations would fund 28 projects for the University of Wisconsin System, including:

$88 million for five-story building on the UW-Madison campus that would house programs in the College of Letters and Science.
$150 million toward demolition and replacement of an 88-year-old engineering research building on the Madison campus.
$26 million for renovating the Music Hall at UW-Madison
$59 million for the renovation of Winther Hall, and roof and exterior window replacement at Heide Hall, both at UW-Whitewater.
$7 million to begin planning for a project at UW-Platteville, renovating Ottensman Hall while demolishing a faculty office tower and four former student residence halls.

In regard to infrastructure improvements for the University of Wisconsin system, State Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley (D) said, ""the University of Wisconsin System has been cut tremendously and with a tuition freeze and recent cuts, they haven't had the resources they need.""

Bewley was referring to cuts that happened during Gov. Evers’ predecessor, former Gov. Scott Walker (R).

Each project listed in the budget proposal contains a justification for why the project is needed. In the case of the Music Hall, the report notes that an exterior wall collapse led to an analysis of the building’s entire exterior, which determined in 2017 that a combination of weather, age and well-intended but damaging repairs had taken a toll on the 137-year-old structure.

“Damage is significant and needs to be addressed immediately before further catastrophic failure occurs,” the budget document states.

Other proposed projects that would aid juveniles include construction of a new $46-million juvenile facility in Milwaukee County, and $2.5 million mental health facility at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution.

The plan also calls for a new $24-million National Guard Readiness Center in Viroqua, and proposed renovations to veterans’ homes and veterans’ cemeteries statewide.

The next step is for the State Building Commission, which is chaired by Evers, to vote on the proposed budget, which is scheduled for March 17. The commission recommendation would then be submitted to the Joint Committee on Finance by April 1.

Nominee Walsh Looks Likely to Be Confirmed,https://www.enr.com/articles/51152-labor-dept-nominee-walsh-looks-likely-to-be-confirmed,4-Feb-21,"Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Dept. of Labor, faced some pointed questions from Republican senators but was praised by Democrats at his confirmation hearing. He seems to be on the road to Senate approval.

In his Feb. 4 appearance before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Walsh, a long-time member of the Laborers' International Union of North America and a former president of a LIUNA Boston local, hewed closely to Biden’s views on a range of labor issues.

[View committee's video of the hearing here.]

For example, he said he supported boosting the number of federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration inspectors and backing an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, from $7.25 now.

Walsh also appeared to endorse a new emergency workplace safety standard related to the coronavirus pandemic.

In his opening statement, Walsh recounted his story, including his father's joining the laborers' union, which he called his family's ""way into the middle class,"" a cancer diagnosis at age seven, and later, his joining his father's local.

He listed the main duties of the Labor Dept. as he sees them, including protecting workers on the job, as well as their pay, benefits and pensions. He also cited continuing education, job training and access to treatment for mental health and substance use.

Committee Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in her opening statement, ""After four years of the Trump administration's attack on working families and a pandemic that continues to push them to the brink, we desperately need a Secretary of Labor like Mayor Walsh, who will fight for workers, not against them.""

Shortly after opening the hearing, Murray announced that she later that day would reintroduce the Protecting the Right to Organize, or PRO, Act. it calls for a variety of union-backed changes in federal labor law, including ending the prohibition against secondary boycott. Biden supports the bill and so does Walsh.

PRO Act Reintroduced

Walsh said that the Pro Act ""is one step towards helping people to organize freely."" He added, ""I do believe in the right of organizing. I do believe in the right of people being able to join the union if they want to join the union.""

In the construction industry, positions are split deeply on the legislation. The measure has the strong backing of the building trades, but faces fierce opposition from Associated Builders & Contractors and the Associated General Contractors of America.

Mike Bellaman, ABC's president and chief executive officer, said in an interview, ""We believe in the right for employees to choose a union—and not to join a union.""

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) blasted the PRO Act, saying that it would be a major blow to the 27 ""right to work"" states, like his own and said it would be ""devastating for the economic future of the nation.""

But perhaps to ease fears of business and GOP lawmakers that he would hold to organized labor's point of view, Walsh at times struck a conciliatory tone. He said, ""Throughout my career, I've led by listening, collaborating and building partnerships,"" adding that, if confirmed he would continue that way.

Walsh also pledged that ""commerce and labor will work together."" He added, ""I promise you we are going to work together for the American worker and the American economy.""

OSHA: Not 'Us vs. Them'

Regarding jobsite safety, Walsh said, ""OSHA should not be an 'us versus them."" Rather, he said the administration and Congress should aim to have OSHA  be ""an agency that is there to help workers and to help employers—and not be put in the middle of both.""

From Walsh's comments at the hearing, Bellaman says, ""We see a lot of shared passions around safety and workforce development,"" as well as helping those with addictions. Walsh noted at the hearing that in this 20s, he was treated for alcoholism and said he is ""a proud member of the recovery community today.""

Bellaman added, ""The guy's from the [construction] industry. So he knows the industry, and I think that that is positive.""

Among other topics, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) told Walsh that for months she has been calling on OSHA to issue an emergency temporary safety standard related to those working during the pandemic. ""This is really long overdue,"" Baldwin said.

Walsh praised grocery store workers, first responders, nurses custodians and other workers on the front lines of keeping the economy operating during the pandemic. Appearing to side with Baldwin, he said, ""If I don't protect those workers....then I don't have a right to be sitting in that [Secretary's] seat.""

He went further, saying that the number of OSHA inspectors has decreased by more than 500 over the past four years and added, ""if we increase [safety] standards and don't increase inspectors, then we really don't protect the American worker.""

Citing worker safety in March 2020, Walsh was the first mayor of a major U.S. city to temporarily halt construction during the COVID-19 outbreak. (ENR named Walsh one of its Top 25 Newsmakers last month.)

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), citing comments from Teamsters' union General President James P. Hoffa, brought up Biden's decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline, resulting in the loss of about 8,000 union jobs.

Like Biden's nominees for other Cabinet-level posts, Walsh said workers who lost their jobs at the Keystone project will be able to find new ones in other energy-related areas, through his Build Back Better plan. But Cassidy said the Keystone jobs were lost immediately, adding, ""The jobs you're describing are in the by and by.""

Minimum Wage

Walsh also got pushback on the proposed boost in the federal minimum wage. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) noted the difference between Boston and his home state in indicators such as the average cost of housing and said a $15 minimum wage ""would kill a lot of jobs in Kansas.""

Walsh said the wage issue would be subject to discussion in Congress and said that if the higher wage were approved, there would be ""many conversations"" about how it would be implemented.

The committee's top Republican, Richard Burr (N.C.), said near the end of the hearing, ""I look forward to the chairman expediting your confirmation and look forward to supporting you.""

Later in the day, Murray announced that the committee will vote on his nomination on Feb. 11.

2020-10-28,Insurance Option Added for Counseling in Times of Stress,https://www.enr.com/articles/50518-insurance-option-added-for-counseling-in-times-of-stress,28-Oct-20,"Construction workers were already suffering from opioid abuse and struggling to deal with mental health problems when Covid-19 added another major stressor.

But many sizable, mid-sized contractors are left to their own devices when dealing with these risks to both the health and safety of their workers and their overall productivity and the bottom line.

Insurer Liberty Mutual, one of the largest providers of workers’ compensation insurance and other insurance policies for the construction industry, has teamed up with a major mental health contractor to offer mid-sized contractors an employee assistance program as an endorsement to the company’s workers’ compensation policies.

Under the agreement with Magellan Healthcare, Liberty Mutual is now offering middle market construction contractors who have workers’ comp policies through Liberty the option of coverage that provides a range of counseling, substance abuse and other services to their employees.

The target market is companies with 1,000 employees or less, which according to Liberty’s research are unlikely to offer their own employee assistance program or at least have access to a robust one that might exist at a larger company.

“Contractors understand the direct link between stress, employee productivity and business performance,” says Liberty Mutual’s construction executive for distribution, Ben Beauvais. “That’s why we found overwhelming buyer and broker interest in accessing an EAP through a workers compensation carrier as we developed the offering.”

However, as Beauvais and Ryan Powers, Liberty Mutual’s Northeast division underwriting manager for construction, explain, the insurer began drafting plans for the coverage before the coronavirus crisis hit, amid the fallout from the opioid addiction crisis.

As a high-risk, high-stress field in which injuries can lead to the use and abuse of prescription opioid painkillers, the construction industry has seen a surge in job-site overdoses over the past few years, according to a study released in early 2020.

The report by the Center for Construction Research and Training found 65 unintentional overdose fatalities in 2018, up from 48 the year before and a total of seven in 2011.

“This journey started well before the coronavirus,” Powers says. “We felt the opioid crisis was so widespread but had particularly hard in the construction space.”

“I have certainly heard stories from our insureds about addicted employees who have come back and vandalized property, and CFOs and risk managers that have had to bury employees,” Powers adds. “There are no worse circumstances than that.”

After the pandemic hit, the two Liberty Mutual construction insurance executives and other team members did a quick reevaluation of whether to push ahead with the program.

“This is so much more than about opioid addiction,” Powers says. “Those stresses are more impactful than they have ever been.”

Liberty Mutual’ recently began offering the employee assistance program at a reduced rate. Services include coaching and counseling for workers dealing with various mental health and substance abuse issues, not to mention financial and legal challenges, among other things.

While the insurance company declined to detail its rates, Liberty Mutual’says it was able to negotiate with Magellan lower rates given the size of its portfolio, with 700 mid-sized construction firms with an average of 300 employees each.

The insurer says it does not expect immediate returns from its rollout, but that it is more about adding value for its base of workers’ comp clients.

“I am not sure how much of a windfall on the business side we can get from this,” Powers says. “It’s more of a goodwill offering. If it generates (more revenue), the bigger the win if that happens.”

But there are also longer-term synergies that could work to reduce costs on both the insurer’s side and the insureds as well.

“This is very attractive from an underwriter’s perspective,” Powers said. “Those kinds of buyers are good kinds of risk, the ones we want to underwrite.”",1,0,0,2
2020-07-19,Former Messer Exec Now Banker Gloria Samuel Says More Effort to Reach Black Community Pays Off,https://www.enr.com/articles/49686-former-messer-exec-now-banker-gloria-samuel-says-more-effort-to-reach-black-community-pays-off,19-Jul-20,"The significance of the cultural shift in U.S. race relations and its impact on construction isn’t lost on Gloria Samuel.

As a Black woman who has made her career in the industry, first as a contractor manager and now as a vice president of Cincinnati's Fifth Third Bank supervising its retail construction portfolio, she says her own story came with no ready-made script and that she “had to figure it out for herself.”

Samuel did not attend college on a scholarship, she had a son to support, and she did not actually see construction as a career option.

“I just learned that you do it the best way you can [and] put the hard work in and everything else will come thereafter,” she says. “I didn't get any scholarships. I didn't know that those things were out there or that they were an option for me. Being a single parent, I just assumed that, hey, I don't qualify for a lot of those things.""

A wrong assumption, Samuel now realizes, remembering that then ""I didn't know the things that I didn't know. So, I didn't have any guidance really to help me through that process.”

“I just learned that you do it the best way you can [and] put the hard work in and everything else will come thereafter.”

– Gloria Samuel, vice president, Fifth Third Bank

Looking back, Samuel says what led her to her current position was improvisation and hard work that paid off.

None of that success insulated her from shock and concern after George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis on May 25, and the protests that followed.

“I didn't want to be at work [that week], because I was so worried about my two boys—especially one that just graduated college in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic—as well as racial injustice.""

She recalls her son's questions: "" ‘What does the world look like for me? Do I want to be out there? Do I want to go to corporate settings and deal with, again, the divide that happens for most people in those situations?’ ” Samuel says.

Samuel well knows those corporate settings, as well as construction projects.

Unlikely Career Path

At Fifth Third Bank, one of the Midwest's largest consumer banks with more than 1,150 branches, she oversees development and implementation of retail banking center construction. This includes scope development, risk analysis, sourcing, scheduling, sequencing and assembling appropriate resources to support the company's strategic objectives.

Before joining Fifth Third in 2018, she spent 17 years in different positions at Messer Construction, the largest contractor in a region that comprises both western Ohio and eastern Kentucky, at which her efforts included bringing people of color into the organization.

Construction wasn't exactly Samuel's first career choice as a student at the University of Cincinnati.

“About the third year that I was in college, I was almost on my way out the door,” she says. ""As much of a commitment that I had made to both myself and my son, it just was really, really difficult. I lived on my own. Obviously, I didn't stay on campus, that wasn't an option. Going into college, I really didn't know what to expect, nor did I know what my career was going to be.”

Samuel said she did not realize while in school that construction would be such a viable career path for her, with little knowledge of the industry or or how construction projects are managed.

“I saw it as people who allow us to have the spaces that we use,” she says. “I didn't yet realize that there could be this career that will come out of that.”

Samuel said that learning about the industry and building her place in it was something she largely had to figure out for herself.

A turning point came when Samuel became a co-op student at employee-owned Messer, which ranks at No. 76 on the ENR Top 400 Contractors list with nearly $1.2 billion in 2019 revenue and is by far the larger builder in Cincinnati. After joining the company and steadily rising from project manager to executive ranks, then-company Chairman and CEO Pete Strange challenged her to support more diverse talent.

""One of the great lies and excuses of non-performance in diversity [in construction] is this: 'Well, we'd love to have them, but they're just not there,' "" says Strange, who now is retired but serves on the board of the National Fund for Workforce Solutions. ""The stupidest person in the town where I grew up in Kentucky knew this about fishing: You have to go somewhere where there's fish.""

Messer needed to make a conceptual leap, says Strange.

""This notion of finding the talent that you want instead of waiting for it to come to you, for Messer, came from the fact that when we became employee-owned, we embraced a capacity model instead of a market-driven model,"" says Strange. ""Traditionally, construction has defined capacity by opportunity. If I can find a job, I'll take the job, and then I'll find the people to build the building.""

He adds that because when the firm became employee-owned in 1990, ""we took on a bunch of debt and a bunch of long-term obligations, we decided that, first, we would find the talent, and then we would find the projects to engage the talent, and that led us to a heightened focus on our talent supply chain.""

A New Approach to Recruitment

Samuel recognized the leadership at Messer was making an effort to bring in more people of color, particularly Black students. Part of that initiative was to stop fishing for new hires from the same lakes and streams. Messer committed, at this stage, to helping recruits who couldn't make the commitment to join the firm because of living expenses or other financial concerns.

Messer began recruiting at black colleges and universities, with Samuel helping to recruit at Tuskegee University.

As Messer’s total of African-American and people of color student recruits increased, she remembers that getting new hires through the door was just the beginning.

“How do we help to support those gaps for people, recognizing that their experience is very different from the traditional student?” Samuel wondered. Financial support was one part of the equation but just a small one compared to the cultural aspects of employing recruits from the community.

“Where the divide still exists is that people are comfortable in their own space and it's very uncomfortable to have conversations about areas or things that are different,” she says.

Samuel says something as benign as office banter and activities of young people away from work could be a barrier.

Groups in the office might say, ‘Hey, let's go canoeing.’ Well, most of the time, their Black peers may not have ever experienced that,"" she says. “Figuring out how do you actually do activities that include everyone, it's not intentional, but it's that unconscious bias, it's what people are familiar with.”

Samuel adds that “there are some people like myself who are willing to say, ‘Oh, I'll step into that space,’ but I'll tell you that sometimes I've said, ‘no, I don't want to do that.’  I feel like I maybe have to explain myself in that scenario where, in reality, I shouldn't have to, because that's just not my experience.”

Better Messaging

During protests after Floyd's death, Samuel said she spoke with former students she mentored in the industry about messages they got from company leaders, with communications sometimes vague and not addressing what the young hires were feeling. She followed up with leaders at those firms, explaining the need for better messaging.

Samuel says industry companies as well as those in other business sectors have to commit to having a conversation about racial justice.

Samuel says industry firms—as well as those in other business sectors—have to commit to having a conversation about racial injustice. What's needed is “a willingness to have the conversation and to hear someone else's point of view,” she says.

Her approach to uplifting Black people includes pouring support into Black-owned businesses to allow more wealth to be passed from generation to generation. It also includes providing opportunities to people that ""challenge the status quo of the typical selection,"" she says.

A larger focus on mental health and social services for the Black community also is vital.

“The core or the root of a lot of things that happen in a negative way for people from my community are related to some sort of mental health issue,"" Samuel says. ""The reason that exists can often be traced to food and shelter insecurity. Our social service organizations can't provide all of that support. In many cases it’s as simple as actually addressing mental health issues and providing that support in lieu of it being a police officer showing up who has no education related to somebody's psychology, per se.”

Since Samuel was a co-op student, one of the most important changes she's seen is the industry's commitment to minority and women-owned businesses.

“We definitely should pride ourselves, in the construction industry, on the fact that we do have a focus on our support for  MBE and WBE enterprises. It's not just providing that support in a percentage, but being intentional about creating those relationships.” While at Messer, Samuel worked in its supplier and workforce diversity units.

While at Messer, the supplier and workforce diversity department was led by Stan Williams. Today, Messer has an Economic Inclusion VP, Sonya Walton, who Samuel remains in contact with. She says Walton has done an amazing job over the years of growing the company’s supplier diversity efforts. Today, Samuel also works with general contractors to develop support for supplier and workforce diversity at Fifth Third Bank as an owner.

But Samuel stresses that there is much more work to do.

""So many young people are interested in the industry but still don’t understand the opportunities available to them,"" she says.

2019-09-28,New Details Revealed in Va. Public Works Shooting,https://www.enr.com/articles/47633-new-detail-revealed-in-va-public-works-shooting,28-Sep-19,"Virginia Beach, Va., police have yet to determine the motive for a city engineer’s May 31 shooting rampage at the municipal complex that left 12 people dead, including a local contractor and public works co-workers, and wounded four others.

In a public briefing, Deputy Chief Patrick L. Gallagher said that while investigators had learned much about the background and behavior of 40-year-old DeWayne Craddock, the exact cause for the nine-year employee’s actions remained elusive.

Craddock died shortly after a gun battle with police. The investigation remains ongoing.

Building 2, where the shootings took place, has been closed since the incident, with public works personnel and other city employees relocated. The city is currently weighing options to demolish or renovate the building.

Many of the more than 750 people interviewed by police since the shooting described Craddock as “quiet, polite, a nice guy and a good listener”—although some victims’ family members and former co-workers disputed those.  Gallagher added that Craddock had no affiliation with external groups, debt problems or physical or mental health issues.

Craddock’legally purchased a total of five guns between 2016 and 2017, and held permits for both a concealed weapon and sound suppressor that was used in the shooting. Body armor he ordered in April had not been delivered before the May 31 incident.

After joining Virginia Beach’s public works department in 2010, Craddock regularly met annual job performance standards until 2017, when he was placed on a performance improvement plan.

His 2018 evaluation indicated “improvement required” and included a written reprimand for job performance from a supervisor, who was not present when the shootings occurred.

While Craddock had apparently not received an evaluation for 2019, his work was expected to be rated “satisfactory.”

Gallagher provided no details on an apparent dispute between Craddock and the city’s purchasing department that occurred in the weeks leading up to the shooting, other than the fact that the engineer’s supervisors supported him in the matter.

On the morning of the shooting, Craddock emailed a letter of resignation and two-weeks notice to his immediate supervisor, citing “personal reasons.”

Police analysis of Craddock’s computer activity that day revealed mostly work-related emails, but also web searches for maps of city facilities, including Building 2.

In the early afternoon, Craddock visited three project sites with two co-workers, neither of whom recalled any unusual behavior. Returning to his office at 3:24 pm,  he sent his last work-related email before leaving the building to retrieve weapons from his car.

According to the timeline provided by Gallagher, Craddock’s first victim, contractor Herbert Snelling, was killed in the municipal center’s parking lot around 4:00 pm. Craddock then entered Building 2, and over the next 15 minutes randomly shot people he encountered as he went from floor to floor.

Police then cornered Craddock in a room, where he was finally subdued after a nearly 30-minute long firefight. Alhough wounded, he continued to resist efforts to be taken into custody or receive medical assistance and was pronounced dead at a Virginia Beach hospital at 5:32 pm.

Gallagher said police have reviewed only about half of the more than 11 terabytes of digital data generated by the investigation, which will likely last another six to nine months. An FBI analysis unit is also involved, he added.

City Council members also received an update on an independent investigation being conducted by Hillard Heintze, a Chicago-based security risk management firm.

CEO Arnette Heintze reported that interviews, surveys and public outreach sessions had revealed multiple concerns about a hostile work environment that put African-American employees at a disadvantage.

“This is a key area of our investigation as it relates to behaviors and motives that give rise to incidents such as this,” Heintze said. Craddock was African-American.

Hillard Heintze will delve into the topic further with an expanded survey of city employees. Heintze said the company had also investigated security at the municipal complex, and would offer best practices for improvements when it submits its final report in mid-November.

While survivors and victims’ family members expressed frustration with the inconclusive updates, Mayor Robert M. Dyer closed the briefing with a reminder that the investigation is far from complete. He also provided assurances that the final reports of both investigations would be made public.

“We still have work to do,” Dyer said.",1,0,0,0
2019-09-12,Lawmakers Grill Corporations about PFAS Contamination,https://www.enr.com/articles/47508-lawmakers-grill-corporations-about-pfas-contamination,12-Sep-19,"As the number of communities in the U.S.  discovering high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) continues to grow, congressional leaders are intensifying efforts to find legislative solutions to address the pervasive problem.

PFAS is a class of man-made chemicals used to manufacture firefighting foam and many household products, including cookware and clothing. Animal, human and scientific studies have shown the chemicals can be toxic, and can cause illnesses, such as pancreatic and testicular cancer, as well as thyroid disease. High levels of PFAS have been found in both wastewater and biosolids, as well as in drinking water systems.

As of March 2019, at least 610 locations in 43 states were known to be contaminated with PFAS chemicals, including drinking water systems serving about 19 million people, the Social Science Environmental Health Institute in Boston said. The number of known contaminated sites was 172 in July 2018.

At a Sept. 10 hearing, Democrats and some Republicans on the House Oversight Committee asked witnesses what lawmakers could do to begin to address the problem, including revising laws such as the Clean Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation and Liability act to speed remediation of contaminated sites. They also chided officials from the companies that manufactured the products—3M and Dupont—for maintaining that their products were safe, when animal and human studies done by their own researchers showed that PFAS chemicals used in their products were harmful to wildlife and humans.

Subcommittee Chairman Harley Rouda (D-Calif.), said although he considers himself a ‘compassionate capitalist,” “the companies here today need to be held accountable.”

Seventy sites contaminated with PFAS have been identified in Michigan and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), said her state is just the tip of the iceberg. “As more states begin to test, we are going to see more,” she said. “This affects Republican and Democratic districts; it’s not a partisan issue,” she said, adding, “Government officials at all levels must work together to determine how to clean up current PFAS contamination, clean it up quickly and efficiently as possible, and prevent any further contaminations and dangers going forward.”

Republican Bob Gibbs of Ohio asked Bob Bilott, an attorney who has worked on lawsuits against the manufacturers of PFAS for two decades, whether there has been enough research to be able to say whether the entire class of PFAS chemicals—which includes some 5,000 compounds--is dangerous. Bilott said, “The chemical similarity of the compounds suggests that we need to be looking at the entire class.” He added that “We have enough information on PFOA, one of the PFAS compounds, to act now,” he said.

The corporations testifying at the hearing were Dupont; Chemours, a Dupont spinoff established in 2015 to house the company’s Teflon lines and other products manufactured with PFAS; and 3M. In her testimony, Denise Rutherford, senior vice president of corporate affairs at 3M, noted that 3M voluntary phased out PFOA and PFOS use in 2000 and is working with the state of Minnesota to support “ongoing remediation” of sites where 3M played a role.

A $739-million settlement, reached between the state of Minnesota and 3M in 2018, established a working group to determine how to appropriate funds from the settlement for drinking water and other solutions at sites and drinking water systems contaminated with PFAS.  ",1,0,0,0
2017-01-18,Cal Beyer: Boosting Industry Awareness About Suicide Prevention,https://www.enr.com/articles/41271-cal-beyer-boosting-industry-awareness-about-suicide-prevention,18-Jan-17,"Calvin ""Cal"" Beyer

Risk professional pushes construction leaders to take steps to improve how their firms handle mental health issues .

Cal Beyer has spent most of his career trying to save lives. Beyer, 55, who has worked for nearly 30 years as a risk and insurance professional, recently took his vast safety experience in a new direction—helping the construction industry to prevent suicides within its ranks.

Beyer points to a new set of statistics, released last July by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that ranks construction second-highest and architecture and engineering fifth-highest among all industries for suicides. The report says the overall suicide rate for construction and mining is 53.3 per 100,000 employees. For engineers and architects, the rate is 32.2 suicides per 100,000 employees.

“This is not just a mental health problem,” Beyer says. “Everybody knows someone affected by suicide. It’s a real, everyday occurrence [that typically has been] swept under the carpet because nobody wants to talk about it.” That’s especially true in construction because of its “tough-guy culture,” he adds. “In police and fire departments, post-traumatic stress and grief counseling is made available as part of the job, but this isn’t happening in construction. Beyer, a Wisconsin native who worked in a hospital at age 16 and lost a longtime friend to suicide in 2015, is now the director of risk management for asphalt paving firm Lakeside Industries, in Issaquah, Wash. A few years back, he decided that, in order to push for better awareness, the industry needed to begin working more closely with mental health professionals, including suicide prevention expert Sally Spencer-Thomas, CEO and cofounder of the Denver-based Carson J. Spencer Foundation. “The tough exterior of many construction workers can prevent them from reaching out and getting much-needed support and treatment,” according to Spencer-Thomas.

Beyer’s work of several years on the issue coalesced into “a perfect storm” of progress in April 2016, when more than 100 industry professionals attended a suicide-prevention summit in Phoenix. Also last year, a comprehensive media campaign led to more than 35 industry associations joining the prevention effort.

“Now, we need to get firms to integrate the message into their health and safety programs,” Beyer says. “It all starts with executive awareness and advocacy.”
